Description: Offline change point detection for Python.
        ------------------------------------------
        
        **ruptures** is a Python library for offline change point detection.
        This package provides methods for the analysis and segmentation of
        non-stationary signals.
        Implemented algorithms include exact and approximate detection for various
        parametric and non-parametric models.
        **ruptures** focuses on ease of use by providing a well-documented and
        consistent interface. In addition, thanks to its modular structure, different
        algorithms and models can be connected and extended within this package.
        
        
        An extensive documentation is available
        `github.com/deepcharles/ruptures <https://github.com/deepcharles/ruptures>`_.
        
        This version requires Python 3 or later.

Offline change point detection for Python.
------------------------------------------

**ruptures** is a Python library for offline change point detection.
This package provides methods for the analysis and segmentation of
non-stationary signals.
Implemented algorithms include exact and approximate detection for various
parametric and non-parametric models.
**ruptures** focuses on ease of use by providing a well-documented and
consistent interface. In addition, thanks to its modular structure, different
algorithms and models can be connected and extended within this package.


An extensive documentation is available
`github.com/deepcharles/ruptures <https://github.com/deepcharles/ruptures>`_.

This version requires Python 3 or later.

Description: Production Module
        #################
        
        The production module defines basics for production management: Bill of
        material and production order.
        
        
        Bill of Material
        ****************
        
        Bills of Material are list of products and quantities needed to produce a
        product. It is often shorten with BOM.
        
        Production
        **********
        
        A Production is mainly defined by a product, a BOM, a location, a quantity and
        two lists of moves:
        
        * Inputs
        
          The moves between the production picking location, or the storage location
          if product picking location is empty, and the production location
          (as defined on the warehouse) for products used for production.
        
        * Outputs
        
          The moves between the production location and the production output
          location, or the storage location if production output is empty, for produced
          products.
        
        The production can be in one of this states:
        
        * Request
        
          The production is requested by the system.
        
        * Draft
        
          Input and output moves are in draft.
        
        * Waiting
        
          The production is waiting for action and all moves are still in draft.
        
        * Assigned
        
          The input moves are assigned.
        
        * Running
        
          The input moves are in state done.
        
        * Done
        
          The output moves are in state done.
        
        * Cancelled
        
          All moves are cancelled.
        
        The cost of the production is computed with the sum of the cost price of all
        incoming products. This cost is allocated to the output products based on the
        list price of each (the product without a list price are considered as waste).
        
        A cron task runs every day and updates the cost of productions if the cost
        price of the incoming products has changed.
        
        
        Rescheduling Production
        -----------------------
        
        It is possible to setup a cron task to reschedule the productions that are
        planned to start in the past. By default they are rescheduled to today.

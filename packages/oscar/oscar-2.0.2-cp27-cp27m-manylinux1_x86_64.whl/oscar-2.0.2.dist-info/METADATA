# Python interface for OSCAR data


This is a convenience library to access World of Code data
(WoC; it was referred internally as oscar while development, hence the name). 
Since everything is stored in local files it won't work unless you have access 
to one of the WoC servers.

### Installation

Normally it is preinstalled on WoC servers. To install manually, 
e.g. to a virtual environment not using system packages, just use pip:

    pip install oscar

Installing from sources requires extra tools to compile (cython, 
manylinux docker image etc), but still possible. Refer to the 
[Build page](https://ssc-oscar.github.io/oscar.py) in the reference.

### Reference

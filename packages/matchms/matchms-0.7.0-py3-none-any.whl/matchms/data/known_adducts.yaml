data_type: "Known adducts"
description: > 
    Adducts allow to infer the ionization mode for mass spectrometry, as well
    at the correct charge value. There are many possible adducts, and adduct
    notation is often not sufficiently standardized.
    This document will list known adducts which can then be used to better
    interpret mass spectra metadata.

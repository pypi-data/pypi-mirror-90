        >`pip install postbot` or `pip3 install postbot`
        
        ###Description
        This tool provides capabilities to make posts on instagram according to content stored in a database 
        and a defined time interval.
        
        For example, let's suppose that you already have many images which you 
        want to post and its corresponding caption text and tags. And you are planning
        to post them on Instagram one each day. So you can store this information in a database
        and **PostBot** automates this task in a few lines of code:
        
        <pre><code>
        from postbot import PostBot
        <br>
        <br>def quickstart():
        
            <br># 1 - Create an instance of PostBot
            <br>    post_bot = PostBot(
            <br>    geckodriver_path=r'/home/you/drivers/geckodriver',
            <br>    username='my_ig_account@mail.com',
            <br>    password='my_password',
            <br>    mysql_host='localhost',
            <br>    mysql_database='posts_db',
            <br>    mysql_username='postman',
            <br>    mysql_password='post_db_pass',
            <br>    mysql_posts_table='posts_table',
            <br>    mysql_img_path_column='post_img_path',
            <br>    mysql_caption_txt_column='post_txt'
            <br>    )
            
            <br># 2 - Login to Instagram
            <br>post_bot.login()
        
            <br># 3 - Start posting
            <br># This function makes a post every amount of minutes specified (1 day = 1440 minutes)
            <br>minutes_in_a_day = 1440
            <br>post_bot.start_posting(minutes_in_a_day)
        
            <br>post_bot.quit()
            <br>
        </code></pre>
        
        That's it! The bot will run till all posts have been posted.
        
        Take into consideration that the database table that has the posts needs a **'posted'** column
        of type boolean with default value of *false*. This is used by the **PostBot** to keep track of the posted posts
        and the pending ones.

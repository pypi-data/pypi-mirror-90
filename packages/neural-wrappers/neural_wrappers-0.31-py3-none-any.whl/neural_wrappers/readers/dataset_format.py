# @param[in] dataBuckets A dictionary with all available data bucket names (data, label etc.) and, for each bucket,
#  a list of dimensions (rgb, depth, etc.).
#  Example: {"data":["rgb", "depth"], "labels":["depth", "semantic"]}
# @param[in] dimGetter For each possible dimension defined above, we need to receive a method that tells us how
#  to retrieve a batch of items. Some dimensions may be overlapped in multiple data bucket names, however, they are
#  logically the same information before transforms, so we only read it once and copy in memory if needed.
# @param[in] dimTransform The transformations for each dimension of each topdata bucket name. Some dimensions may
#  overlap and if this happens we duplicate the data to ensure consistency. This may be needed for cases where
#  the same dimension may be required in 2 formats (i.e. position as quaternions as well as unnormalized 6DoF).

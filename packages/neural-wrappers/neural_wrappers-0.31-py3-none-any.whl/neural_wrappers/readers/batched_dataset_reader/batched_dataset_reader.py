	# batches = [ B1, B1, B1, B2, B2, B3, B4, B4, B5] where B1 is the batch for index 1 (len 3), B2 for index 2 etc.
	# We are still passing a routing table, however this routing table is for batch indexes.
	# Thus, for this epoch we have a list of batches, which can be anything iterable:
	#  batches = reader.getBatches() and batches[ix] = the ixth batch, where ix is a number going from
	#  [0 : len(batches) - 1]. What we get from batches[ix] is an access operator, which is understood by the underyling
	#  __getitem__/dimGetter structure. It can be a list of raw indexes, a slice, a range etc.

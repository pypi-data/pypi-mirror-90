Description: # Micropython MDNS #
        
        [![PyPi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/micropython-mdns) ![MIT licensed](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/micropython-mdns)](https://pypi.org/project/micropython-mdns/)
        
        ![Image showing service discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cbrand/micropython-mdns/main/images/service-discovery.gif)
        
        A pure Python implementation of [MDNS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762) and the [Service Discovery](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6763) protocol over MDNS 
        for [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/).
        
        ## Intended Audience ##
        
        You should not use this library if you "just" require MDNS A record lookup and Host annoucement if there is already baked in support in your MicroPython distribution.
        This is for example the case with the default ESP32 MicroPython distribution since v1.12. This will be in all cases more resource efficient.
        
        If you, however, require additional functionality like Service Discovery and Annoucement, you should use this library. It supports all functionality of existing
        basic MDNS implementations plus these features so you will not loose any functionality.
        
        ## Installation ##
        
        The library is available on PyPi and can be installed via upip.
        
        ```python
        import upip
        upip.install("micropython-mdns")
        ```
        
        For using this library, native C type implementations of MDNS which use the MDNS service port need to be disabled. For example, this project has been developed
        on the ESP32 which MicroPython implementation per default has a basic MDNS implementation available. This does only support local A record lookups and A record
        responding of its own host address. 
        
        The [releases page](https://github.com/cbrand/micropython-mdns/releases) on this project publishes a firmware.bin which is MicroPython 1.13 with MDNS disabled in each release for easy usage. It can also be built when
        having docker locally installed by running in the console the build command:
        
        ```bash
        make build
        ```
        
        Refer to the [`config`](https://github.com/cbrand/micropython-mdns/tree/main/config/boards) directory to see the configuration files when baking this into your own MicroPython ESP32 build.
        
        Other MicroPython implementations might not require any changes inside of the firmware.
        
        ## Usage ##
        
        The library requires [`uasyncio`](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/uasyncio.html) to function. All handling is done asynchronously.
        
        Examples on how to utilize the libraries can be found in the [`examples`](https://github.com/cbrand/micropython-mdns/tree/main/examples) folder.
        
        ## Reference ##
        
        A basic API reference for the public API is inside of the [REFERENCE.md](https://github.com/cbrand/micropython-mdns/blob/main/REFERENCE.md).
        
        ## Caveats ##
        
        - Depending on your MicroPython implementation, you must disable MDNS in the firmware.
        - Currently no support for IPv6 is implemented.
        - Depending how chatty the network is, service responders and discovery might require a lot of memory. If the memory is filled by the buffer of the underlying socket, [the socket is closed and reopened](https://github.com/cbrand/micropython-mdns/blob/d3dd54f809629ca41c525f5dec86963a6d75e903/src/mdns_client/client.py#L100) which looses data. It, however, seems to work fine enough in tests on an ESP32 without external memory. Depending on the project size, a module with external RAM might be advisable.
        
        ## License ##
        
        The library is published under the [MIT](https://github.com/cbrand/micropython-mdns/blob/main/LICENSE) license.

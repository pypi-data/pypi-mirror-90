Description: The TensorFlow official models are a collection of
        models that use TensorFlow's high-level APIs.
        They are intended to be well-maintained, tested, and kept up to date with the
        latest TensorFlow API. They should also be reasonably optimized for fast
        performance while still being easy to read.

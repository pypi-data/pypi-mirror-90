History
-------

1.1 (2020-01-06)
++++++++++++++++

* Fixes for various things that broke with more recent versions
  Firefox/Chrome/geckodriver/chromedriver etc.

  * It is possible that if you are on older versions of Firefox you may have
    regressions or different behaviour with handling of linebreaks e.g. sending
    ``\r\n`` into textarea.

* Installation fix so that it can be installed with poetry
* Tested against more recent Django versions (up to 3.1), and fixed issues.
* Dropped support for Python 3.3 and 3.4
* Dropped support for Django 1.8, 1.9, 1.10 (which seemed to be broken anyway?)

1.0.4
+++++

* Fixed bug with setting checkboxes if a form had multiple checkboxes of the same name
* Enabled installation on PyPy (doesn't necessarily work completely).
* Test against Django 2.1
* Removed tests and official support for PhantomJS. (No actual functionality
  was changed regarding PhantomJS).

1.0.3
+++++

* Deprecated ``fill_by_id``. Instead of ``fill_by_id({'foo': 'bar'})`` you
  should do ``fill({'#foo': 'bar'})``, because it is shorter and more flexible.

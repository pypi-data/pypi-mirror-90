Description: pyyAudioDspTools is a python 3 package for manipulating audio by just using numpy. This can be from a .wav or as a stream 
        via pyAudio for example. pyAudioDspTool's only requirement is Numpy. The package is only a few kilobytes in size. 
        You can find the readthedocs here: https://pyaudiodsptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
        
        You can use pyAudioDspTools to start learning about audio dsp because all relevant operations are in plain sight,
        no C or C++ code will be called and nearly no blackboxing takes place. You can also easily modify all available audio
        effects and start writing your own, you only need to know python and numpy as well as audio dsp basics. As this package 
        is released under the MIT licence, you can use it as you see fit. If you want to examine the code, just open the
        'pyAudioDspTools' folder in this Git and you can see all the relevant modules.

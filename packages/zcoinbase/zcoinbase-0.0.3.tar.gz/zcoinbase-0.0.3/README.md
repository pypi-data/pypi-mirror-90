# zcoinbase

A simple python client that implements simple interfaces to Coinbase Pro API.

This project uses minimal libraries to interface with the Coinbase API directly, it does
not depend on any other Coinbase Python libraries (it directly interfaces with the 
REST, Websocket and FIX APIs)

## Coinbase API
If you plan on using this API, you should familiarize yourself with the Coinbase Pro API here: https://docs.pro.coinbase.com/ 

## Warning
This API is in a highly experimental, developmental state, use at your own risk.

## Under Developement
In order of Priorities, here are the TODOs for this.
- Release to PyPi
- Authenticated Websocket  
- Simple Client for Dealing with Websocket Messages (Real-time Market)
  - The idea for this is to provide a real-time interface to the market that does not
    require *any* knowledge of how the Websocket API works
- FIX API

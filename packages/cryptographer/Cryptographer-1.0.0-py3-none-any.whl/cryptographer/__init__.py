"""
Cryptographer - A Python Cryptography and Hashing Module

Ciphers Included: 
    - Vigenere Cipher (VigenereKey)
    - RSA Cipher (RSAKey)
Hashers Included:
    - Salted Password Hasher (Password)

All of the above ciphers and hashers are combined into one class: 
    - The Cryptographer (Cryptographer)

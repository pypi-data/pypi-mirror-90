# Uncomment (set to True) to build XSPEC extension
#with-xspec=True

# If with-xspec is True, make sure to point Sherpa to right
# XSPEC-related libraries and to indicate the XSPEC version.
# As of XSPEC 12.10.0, determining the version os XSPEC at build
# time is too complex and unreliable. If you have XSPEC 12.9.0
# you can leave the version option commented out.
#
# The xspec_include_dirs and xspec_lib_dirs items should be set
# to $HEADAS/include and $HEADAS/lib respectively (expand out the
# environment variable).
#
# If you are using a full XSPEC build, then add the correct version
# numbers to the cfitsio, CCfits, and wcs libraries used in the build,
# if necessary. For XSPEC 12.11.1 (HEAsoft 6.28) this means using
# CCfits_2.5, wcs-5.19.1, and hdsp_6.28.
#
# For XSPEC 12.10.0 and later, the xspec_libraries line should
# be changed to
#
#   xspec_libraries = XSFunctions XSUtil XS hdsp_<version>
#
# If you are using the models-only XSPEC build, then the cfitsio_lib_dirs,
# ccfits_lib_dirs, and wcslib_lib_dirs will need to be set if
# these libraries are installed in a different location to the XSPEC
# libraries.
#
# The gfortran_lib_dirs should be set if needed.

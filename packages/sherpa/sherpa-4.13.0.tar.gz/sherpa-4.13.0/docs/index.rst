Welcome to the Sherpa documentation.
`Sherpa <https://cxc.harvard.edu/contrib/sherpa/>`_
is a Python package for
modeling and fitting data. It was originally developed by the
`Chandra X-ray Center <https://cxc.harvard.edu/>`_ for use in
`analysing X-ray data (both spectral and imaging)
<https://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa>`_
from the  Chandra X-ray telescope, but it is designed to be a
general-purpose package, which can be enhanced with domain-specific
tasks (such as X-ray Astronomy).
Sherpa contains an expressive and powerful
modeling language, coupled with a
range of statistics and robust optimisers.

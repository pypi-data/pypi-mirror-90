<p>This notebook is more of a blog-style where I'll be discussing what I found useful to know and understand about how research is different and ideas/concepts you should keep in mind:</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Understanding-the-Data">Understanding the Data<a class="anchor-link" href="#Understanding-the-Data"> </a></h2><ul>
<li>Understanding the ins and outs of the data plays a large role in being able to interpret behaviors about your model and its performance</li>
<li>Without this we're just throwing a model at data and while we could perform well, you'll be asked <em>why</em> and understanding <strong>both</strong> the <em>data</em> and the <em>technique</em> let's you do so</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Understanding-the-Techniques">Understanding the Techniques<a class="anchor-link" href="#Understanding-the-Techniques"> </a></h2><ul>
<li>You'll be the expert in neural networks on the team (I've found), so you need to <em>make sure</em> what you're telling your team is accurate and reliable information</li>
<li>I found this a particular struggle</li>
<li><strong>Test Sets</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://www.fast.ai/2017/11/13/validation-sets/">How (and why) to create a good validation set</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Understanding-how-to-Interpret-the-Techniques">Understanding how to <em>Interpret</em> the Techniques<a class="anchor-link" href="#Understanding-how-to-Interpret-the-Techniques"> </a></h2><ul>
<li>This is especially hard with tabular, as many researchers still view neural networks as black boxes where we can never know what's going on</li>
<li>Understanding how to use the various tools to interpret models for your peers/partners in a way that they can understand is extremely valuable. While we may understand what <a href="https://github.com/muellerzr/Practical-Deep-Learning-for-Coders-2.0/blob/master/Tabular%20Notebooks/03_ClassConfusion.ipynb">ClassConfusion</a>, <a href="https://github.com/muellerzr/Practical-Deep-Learning-for-Coders-2.0/blob/master/Tabular%20Notebooks/03_SHAP.ipynb">SHAP</a>, etc is doing in the background, it's another set of skills entirely to <em>communicate</em> this effectively</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="You-are-keeping-yourself-accountable">You are keeping yourself accountable<a class="anchor-link" href="#You-are-keeping-yourself-accountable"> </a></h2><ul>
<li><p>If you're ever iffy about anything, <em>automatically</em> assume you need to read a bit more into how to make something work</p>
</li>
<li><p>I had this issue with my research project</p>
</li>
<li>Probably the hardest thing to do is admit when you are wrong, but it's <em>especially</em> important to do so before it's too late</li>
</ul>

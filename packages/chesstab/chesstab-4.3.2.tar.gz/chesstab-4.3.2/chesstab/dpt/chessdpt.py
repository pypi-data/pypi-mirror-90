        But single-step works on FreeBSD7.2 wine-1.1.0,1 dptv2r19.
        Wine source code comments state that memory-use calls do not return
        correct values. Evidently the incorrectness can vary by version
        making the DPT workarounds liable to fail also.

        runchessdptdu.py does DPT's single-step deferred update process.
        runchessdptduchunk.py does DPT's single-step deferred update process
        but splits the task into fixed size chunks, a number of games, which
        it is hoped are small enough to finish before all memory is used.
        runchessdptdumulti.py does DPT's multi-step deferred update process.

"""Chess Query Language (CQL) statement parser.

Thes extracts from http://www.gadycosteff.com/cql/doc/operation.html for cql5.1
briefly describe CQL and how the cql.exe program operates.

A CQL statement has three parts:

    The word cql
    The cql parameters: a sequence of cql parameters enclosed in parentheses
    The cql body: a sequence of filters

CQL successively reads each game in its input PGN file. For each such game, CQL
plays through each move in the game.

Every time CQL reaches a position, it sets the current position to that
position. Then CQL tries to match each of its filters against that position.
If all the filters in the CQL file match the position, then CQL is said to have
matched the position.

When CQL has finished trying to match all the positions in the game against its
filters, then if any of the positions matched, CQL will output the game to the
output file. The output file can be specified either by default (in which case
its name is the name of the CQL file with -out appended); or as a parameter in
to the cql arguments in the CQL file itself; or on the command line. 


The earlier partial position scheme implemented a sequence of piece designator
filters in CQL terms.  The equivalent of piece designator was limited to the
form 'Ra3', with pieces identified as one of 'KQRBNPkqrbnp?Xx-' where X is
replaced by A, x by a, ? by [Aa], and - by [Aa.], in CQL.  'A' is any white
piece, 'a' is any black piece, and '.' is an empty square. '[Aa.]' means it
does not matter whether the square is occupied because either white piece or
black piece or empty square matches.

"""Convert UCI Chess Engine moves to PGN.

UCI chess engines give moves as <from square><to square> and the easiest way of
handling these, given the existing PGN parser, is translate to PGN.

generate_pgn_for_uci_moves_in_position() generates the legal unambiguous PGN
description of a sequence of UCI Chess Engine move for the position it refers
to.

'Qd1f3' is always unambiguous but is the legal unambiguous description only if
more than two queens of the side with the move can legally move to 'f3'. 'Qf3'
is usually the only legal PGN description because the starting position for a
game has one queen per side. 'Qf3' is not necessarily a legal move.

    Parameters for Berkeley DB, DPT, and Sqlite3, are defined.

    Ignore settings irrelevant to the database engine in use.

    Berkeley DB and Sqlite3 look after themselves for sizing purposes when
    increasing the size of a database.

    The sizing parameters for the Games file in DPT were chosen using figures
    from a few game collections: ~25000 games in 4NCL up to 2011, ~4500 games
    in a California collection spanning the 20th century, ~2500 games in a
    collection of Volga Gambit games, ~150000 games from section 00 of
    enormous.pgn, ~500 games from 1997 4NCL divisions one and two separately.

    There is not enough data to conclude that Table D usage is proportional
    to the index entries per game, but it is reasonable to expect this and
    the Positions and Table D ratios in the two 528 game samples are close
    enough to make the assumption.  Above, say, 20000 games it is assumed
    that typical games, 75 positions per game and 23 pieces per position,
    lead to a Table B to Table D ratio of 8, or 14 when CQL statements are
    supported.  The higher ratios at lower numbers of games are assumed to
    arise from the lower chance of compressed inverted lists.

    It is completely unclear what value to use for records per Table B page
    because games can have comments and variations as well as just the moves
    played.  The samples have few comments or variations. A value of 10 seems
    as good a compromise as any between wasting space and getting all record
    numbers used. 16 average sized records would fit on a Table B page.

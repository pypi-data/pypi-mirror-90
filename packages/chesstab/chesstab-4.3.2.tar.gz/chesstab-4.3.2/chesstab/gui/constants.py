Many of the constants are used to generate tkinter.Text tag and mark names
used when highlighting game scores in various widgets.

#names of chess score text management tags
'''The primary tags are POSITION<suffix> and TOKEN<suffix> where suffix is a
serial number.  Every character is tagged by one TOKEN tag and for each TOKEN
tag there is a corresponding POSITION tag which tags all the non-separator
characters tagged by TOKEN.  There is always at least one trailing separator
character and there may be leading separator characters.  A TOKEN_MARK<suffix>
mark is associated with each TOKEN<suffix> and indicates the insertion point
for editing the token.  An empty token has no position range, and maybe no
POSITION tag, and the TOKEN_MARK is used to initialise the POSITION range.

The NAVIGATE_COMMENT NAVIGATE_TOKEN and NAVIGATE_MOVE tags contain the existing
POSITION ranges for the tokens of the relevant types.

RAV_SEP<suffix> is the only tag which collects TOKEN ranges which are used to
colour variations when there is a choice of moves available (recursive
annotation variations).

Each EDIT_... range indicates which tokens are currently editable.  Note that
only the last move in a line is editable.  The tag name is used to pick the
editing rules applied to the token.

An EDIT_MOVE range must be the last range in a RAV_MOVES tag that is also a
NAVIGATE_MOVE range.

Note that WHITESPACE is not used but is intended for picking out editable
whitespace and will be used, if necessary, as NAVIGATE_WHITESPACE.

RAV... tags refer to all moves between matching PGN RAV tags although only
the relevant characters for the Tk tag's purpose get tagged.
LINE... tags refer to all moves to the right of the current move until the
next unmatched PGN END RAV tag.
VARIATION... tags refer to all moves to the right of the current move until the
next unmatched PGN START RAV tag.
So moves4 and moves6 are in LINE... tags while moves4 and moves6 are in
VARIATION... tags for currentmove in the sequence:
"( moves1 ( moves2 ) moves3 currentmove moves4 ( moves5 ) moves6 )".
This sequence has three sets of RAV... tags: one for the whole sequence and
one each for the sub-sequences "( moves2 )" and "( moves5 )".
'''
# LINE... and VARIATION... got used this way in wxWidgets days so RAV... is
# borrowed from PGN terminology to do the 'whole variation' tasks.  In chess
# cirles the terms line and variation are mostly interchangable, but if talking
# about a game, variations refers to alternatives to the moves actually played.

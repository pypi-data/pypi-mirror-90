"""Widgets to display and edit chess engine definitions.

These three classes display chess engine definitions in their own Toplevel
widget: they are used in the enginedbdelete, enginedbedit, and enginedbshow,
modules.

The EngineDialogue class binds events to navigate between widgets.

The DialogueEngineDisplay class adds insert and delete record to the
EngineDialogue class.

The DialogueEngineEdit class adds insert and edit record to the
EngineDialogue class.

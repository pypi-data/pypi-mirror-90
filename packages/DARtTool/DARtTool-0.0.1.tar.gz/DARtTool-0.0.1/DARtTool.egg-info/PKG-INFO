Description: A tool to estimate Instantaneous Reproduction Number(Rt)
        ========================================================
        
        cal\_r() provide real-time estimation of time-varying distribution of Rt
        and infected numbers from a range of epidemic observations (e.g., number
        of onsets and confirmed cases).
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        dart = DARt(GT,D\_s,Filename)
        
        cal\_r()
        
        Arguments
        ---------
        
        GT: generation time distribution; GT[0] represents the probability that
        the secondary infection case occurs 1 day after the primary infection.
        
        D\_s: delay time distribution; D\_s[0] represents the probability that
        an individual infected is observed after 1 day.
        
        Filename: input file; this file should contain date and corresponding
        observations, the date should be sorted from the oldest to the latest.
        See 'Example\_input.csv'.

        This tool is described in the following paper:'Revealing the
        Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19: A Bayesian Framework for R\_t
        Estimation'
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        ::
        
            GT = [0, 0, 0.165720874545241, 0.226350757019051, 0.245007574714227, 0.213515210247327, 0.149405583474155]  
            D_s = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.0996906, 0.1130266, 0.1143032, 0.1069238, 0.0937167999999999]
            dart = DARt(GT=GT, D_s=D_s, filename='Example_input.csv')
            dart.cal_r()

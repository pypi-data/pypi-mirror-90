## ⬇️ Install

Note that if installing from PyPi or building from source, [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) needs to already be installed, and [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) is required if using the `--pr` flag.

### Homebrew 🍺

Binary bottles are available for x86_64_linux, catalina and big_sur.

```
brew install harens/tap/seaport
```

### PyPi 🐍

```
pip install seaport
```

## 💻 Usage

```txt
> seaport --help
Usage: seaport [OPTIONS] NAME

  Bumps the version number and checksum of NAME, and copies the result to
  your clipboard

Options:
  --version                 Show the version and exit.
  --bump TEXT               The new version number
  --pr PATH                 Location for where to clone the macports-ports
                            repo

  --test / --no-test        Runs port test
  --lint / --no-lint        Runs port lint --nitpick
  --install / --no-install  Installs the port and allows testing of basic
                            functionality

  --help                    Show this message and exit.
```

### 🚀 Use of sudo

Sudo is only required if `--test`, `--lint` or `--install` are specified, and it will be asked for during runtime. This is since the local portfile repo needs to be modified to be able to run the relevant commands.

Any changes made to the local portfile repo are reverted during the cleanup stage.

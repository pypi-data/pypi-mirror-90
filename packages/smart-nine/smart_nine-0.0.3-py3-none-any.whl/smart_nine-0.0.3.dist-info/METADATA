# Instagram Smart Nine
smart-nine is a command-line application written in Python that generates an Instagram user's smart nine photograph collage from a particular year.

Example collage:

## Install

To install smart-nine:

```
$ pip install smart-nine
```

## Usage

To generate a smart nine collage:

```
$ smart-nine <username> -u <your username> -p <your password>
```

*NOTE: To generate a smart-nine collage for a `<username>` which media is set to private, `<your username>` must be an approved follower of `<username>`.*

The resulting collage will be saved as: `/smart-nine-output/<username>_<year>.jpg`

## Options
|Argument| Description|
|--|--|
|--help, -h| Show help message and exit.|
|--login-user, -login_user, -u| Instagram scraper login user.|
|--login-pass, -login_pass, -p| Instagram scraper login password.|
|--year, -y| Year to use as filter for the smart nine collage.|
|--timezone, -t| Timezone of Instagram user(s).|
|--scrape, -s| Data scraping flag - set to False to work with local data.|

## Motivation
The current software applications for generating Instagram year photo collages suffer from the following:

- They only display the 9 photographs that have the most likes.
- They require you to enter your personal email (which they use to send spam), or...
- They overlay unwanted graphics on top of the resulting image.

        History
        =======
        
        2.1.1 (2021-01-05)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed an error in extract_point_from_raster(). It was sometimes
          picking up a neigbouring pixel instead of the correct one.
        
        2.1.0 (2020-10-02)
        ==================
        
        - h_integrate() now adds a "UNIT" metadata item to the produced raster
          with the unit of measurement as specified in the input files.
          Conversely, PointTimeseries reads the "UNIT" metadata item from the
          rasters and sets it in the returned HTimeseries object.
        
        2.0.0 (2020-01-05)
        ==================
        
        - Now uses version 5 of hts file (i.e. different time step notation).
        
        1.3.0 (2019-12-12)
        ==================
        
        - Added option default_time to PointTimeseries.
        
        1.2.2 (2019-11-24)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed a bug where extract_point_from_raster() was modifying the point
          passed to it.
        
        1.2.1 (2019-10-23)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed a bug where hts files were opened in the wrong mode, with
          inconsistent results (this is another occurence of the bug that had
          been fixed in 0.1.2).
        
        1.2.0 (2019-09-11)
        ==================
        
        - Added test utility setup_test_raster() to make unit testing easier.
        
        1.1.0 (2019-08-23)
        ==================
        
        - Added option "version" to PointTimeseries.get_cached() so that it can
          save in different file format versions.
        
        1.0.1 (2019-08-22)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed a bug in extract_point_from_timeseries() where it was sometimes
          raising the wrong exception type (depending on GDAL version).
        
        1.0.0 (2019-08-16)
        ==================
        
        - The API for extract_point_timeseries_from_rasters() has changed.
          Instead of a function, there's now a PointTimeseries class.
        - When extracting a point timeseries from rasters, start_date and
          end_date can now be specified.
        
        0.2.0 (2019-08-13)
        ==================
        
        - When extracting point time series from a set of rasters, it is now
          possible to provide a prefix as well as a list of files, and it is
          also possible to save the extracted time series to a file, optionally
          only if the file is outdated.
        - extract_point_from_raster (and extract_point_timeseries_from_rasters)
          now supports GeoDjango (GEOS) Point objects besides GDAL Point
          objects.
        - Function coordinates2point has been added.
        
        0.1.2 (2019-07-30)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed a bug where hts files were opened in the wrong mode, with
          inconsistent results.
        
        0.1.1 (2019-07-05)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed an ugly timezone bug that caused the data to refer to a
          different time than what the timestamp actually said.
        - When the timezone was missing from the input files, there was an
          incomprehensible AttributeError. This was fixed and now it provides an
          understandable error message.
        
        0.1.0 (2019-06-21)
        ==================
        
        - Initial release

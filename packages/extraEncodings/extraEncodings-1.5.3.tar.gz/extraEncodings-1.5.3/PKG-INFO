Description: # Extra encodings for Python 
        #### Full documentation available at [sites.google.com](https://sites.google.com/view/extra-encodings-docs/)
        ------
        
        
        ## Update 1.4
        ---
        Added Gui with tkinter\
        Finshed ichor\
        Added a class for a 2 way dict in classsstuff.py so check that out\
        Added a class to make an Encoding in ciphers.py, if you want to know how to use\
        Decided to delete encodingsbeta  and instead use beta releases
        
        
        ## Plans:
        ----
        Add a function that makes a encoding\
        Add documentation\
        Adding more encodings/decodings\
        Make my TwoWayDict class more feature rich. (1/3 finshed)\
        Add Binary encodings
        
        
        ## Notes
        ----
        This is my first ever package (Which no one has ever installed)\
        Ichor is not available in GUI due to  dictionary)'s being stubborn\
        Currently we only support all characters on a US keyboard for all encoding types and a computer that runs a standard os like Win32/64 , macOS (Not tested), Linux Debian,Ubuntu and distros based on them.
        
        ## Planned and Implmented Decodings and encodings:
        ----
        Ichor\
        Gen2\
        LTF-64\
        GTX2\
        LGC(To  be added to encoders 1.4.6 and made in ciphers.py 1.4.5)\
        
        ## How to import
        ----
        ```p
            import extraEncodings
            #to import all
            from extraEncodings import *
            #to import encoder
            from extraEncodings import encodings
            #to import  classes and encoder making
            from extraEncodings import classstuff
            #To run the script that shows you how to use the class Encoding(). For now there is no documentation for anything other than this.
            from extraEncodings import CreateAnEncoding
            #to import  raw encoders
            from extraEncodings import ciphers
            #to import gui
            from extraEncodings import encodingsGui
        
        ```

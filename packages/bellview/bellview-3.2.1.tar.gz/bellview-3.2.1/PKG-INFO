Description: Bell View is an interactive method explorer for church bell ringers
        which uses a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It works out the rows of
        a plain course or touch, displays it the screen, and audibly rings it
        using a set of bell sample files. Bell View makes use of the Change
        Ringing Engine (crengine).
        
        Installation instructions and a user manual are available on the
        Harrogate Bell Ringers' website

Bell View is an interactive method explorer for church bell ringers
which uses a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It works out the rows of
a plain course or touch, displays it the screen, and audibly rings it
using a set of bell sample files. Bell View makes use of the Change
Ringing Engine (crengine).

Installation instructions and a user manual are available on the
Harrogate Bell Ringers' website

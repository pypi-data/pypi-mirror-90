        ## Overview
        
        The IBM Cloud Schematics Python SDK allows developers to programmatically interact with the following
        IBM Cloud services:
        
        Service Name | Imported Class Name
        --- | ---
        [Schematics](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/schematics) | schematicsv1 
        
        ## Prerequisites
        
        [ibm-cloud-onboarding]: https://cloud.ibm.com/registration
        
        * An [IBM Cloud][ibm-cloud-onboarding] account.
        * An IAM API key to allow the SDK to access your account. Create one [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).
        * Python 3.5.3 or above.
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install, use `pip` or `easy_install`:
        
        ```bash
        pip install --upgrade "ibm-schematics>=1.0.0"
        ```
        
        or
        
        ```bash
        easy_install --upgrade "ibm-schematics>=1.0.0"
        ```
        
        ## Authentication
        
        The library requires Identity and Access Management (IAM) to authenticate requests. There are several ways to set the properties for authentication
        
        1. [As environment variables](#authenticate-with-environment-variables)
        2. [The programmatic approach](#authenticate-programmatically)
        3. [With an external credentials file](#authenticate-with-external-configuration)
        
        ### Authenticate with environment variables
        
        For Schematics IAM authentication set the following environmental variables by replacing <apikey> with your proper service credentials.
        
        ```
        SCHEMATICS_URL = https://schematics.cloud.ibm.com
        SCHEMATICS_APIKEY = <apikey>
        ```
        
        ### Authenticate with external configuration
        
        To use an external configuration file, see the related documentation in the [Python SDK Core document about authentication](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-cloud-sdk-common/blob/master/README.md).
        
        ### Authenticate programmatically
        
        To learn more about how to use programmatic authentication, see the related documentation in the [Python SDK Core document about authentication](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-cloud-sdk-common/blob/master/README.md).
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        A quick example to get you up and running with Schematics Python SDK service
        
        ```
        
        from ibm_cloud_sdk_core.authenticators import IAMAuthenticator
        from ibm_schematics.schematics_v1 import SchematicsV1
        
        authenticator = IAMAuthenticator('<apiKey>')
        schematics_service = SchematicsV1(authenticator = authenticator)
        schematics_service.set_service_url('https://schematics.cloud.ibm.com')
        
        get_schematics_version_response = schematics_service.get_schematics_version()
        version_response = get_schematics_version_response.get_result()
        print(version_response)
        
        
        ```
        
        ## Error handling
        
        For sample code on handling errors, please see [Schematics API docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/schematics#error-handling).

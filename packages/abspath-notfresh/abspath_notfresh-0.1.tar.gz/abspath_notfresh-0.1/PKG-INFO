Description: # Intro
        This is a command tool like linux command `pwd` but stronger.  
        
        
        It's really efficient.  
        
        When you want to copy a absolute path of some file in your shell, you have to use pwd and then append the file  name, and select it with your mouse or use `control + c`, but now, just use abspath 
        *filename* and it will copy the absolute path to your clipboard.   
        
        This just save you 3 seconds at lease per operation.  
        
        # Requirements
        just require python3.6+ and a pip package `pyperclip`.
        
        # Usage  
        
        
        You can use the command `abspath ` without param to copy the current directory path or `abspath file_or_dir_in_this directory` to copy the full path to your clipbord.  
        Just so easy and enjoy it!

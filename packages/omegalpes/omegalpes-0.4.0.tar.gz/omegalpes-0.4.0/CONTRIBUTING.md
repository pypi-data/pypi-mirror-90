Code contribution
=================

Please, have a look to the README or the documentation if you need help for
installing OMEGAlpes as a developer.
Your code will be reviewed, tested and inserted into the master branch.

Your code style must follow some rules, described in the following section.

Please, write unittest with your code to increase the chance and reducing the
time of integrating your code in OMEGAlpes lib.

Note that your contributions must be released under the project's license

Steps Reminder:
1. Coding & Unit tests time!
2. Commit to keep a track of your work and do not forget to rebase the master branch 
onto your branch
/!\ do not delete part of the code, add a DEPRECATED info
3. Test the Unittests of OMEGAlpes and adjust your code if it does not work
4. Do not forget to comment your code and your tests
5. Update also the main docstring of your modules
6. Check the PEP-8 for both your code and your tests
(with pylint lib, on the command prompt, go to the folder of your module
and write 'pylint file_name.py')
7. Update with your new functionalities the file docs/new_functionalities/vX.x
8. Comment related issue if an issue is linked to you code
9. Push on your branch
10. If you think you're ready you can request a merge


Code Style
==========

Overall, try to respect PEP-8 
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>

If you use PyCharm or VS Code, most of the rules described here are already
checked.

General
-------

* Your code must be compatible with Python 3.6+.
* Remove unused imports.
* Imports must be after module documentation and before anything else.

Formatting
----------

* Avoid inline comments; use 2 spaces when using them (mainly for type hinting)
* Break long lines after **80** characters. Exception for URLs and type hinting
  as they don't support line breaks
* Delete trailing whitespace.
* Don't include spaces after ``(``, ``[``, ``{`` or before ``}``, ``]``, ``)``.
* Don't misspell in method names.
* Don't vertically align tokens on consecutive lines.
* Use 4 spaces indentation (no tabs).
* Use an empty line between methods.
* Use 2 empty lines before class definitions.
* Use spaces around operators.
* Use spaces after commas and colons.
* Use Unix-style line endings (``\n``).
* Use 3 double-quotes (``"""``) for documentation

Naming
------

* Use ``CamelCase`` for class names.
* Use ``SNAKE_UPPERCASE`` for constants.
* Use ``snake_case`` for method names.
* ``CamelCase`` is allowed for decorator methods.
* First argument of:

  * instance methods must be ``self``
  * class methods must be ``cls``

Organization
------------

Documentation about a new functionalities should be added to a new file in
``docs/new_functionalities``.

Tests should be added to either an existing or a new sub-folder of ``tests``.
Unit tests are based on ``unittest``.

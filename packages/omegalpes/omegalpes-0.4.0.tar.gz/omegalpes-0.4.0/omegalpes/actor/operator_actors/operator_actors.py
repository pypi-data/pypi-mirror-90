    **Description**

        OperatorActor class inherits from the the basic class Actor. It
        enables one to model an actor who operates energy units which is part
        of its scope of responsibility.
        An operator actor has objectives and constraints which are
        linked to the energy units he operates.

    **Attributes**

     - name : name of the actor
     - operated_unit_list:  list of the energy units operated by the actor or
       more precisely in its scope of responsibility

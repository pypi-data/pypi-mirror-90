OMEGAlpes Graphical Representation
==================================

The energy systems developed in OMEGAlpes are describes following
a specified graph representation.

Energy Unit representation
--------------------------
The energy units are describes as rectangles as presented just below.
The graph is adapted considering if the unit is a
variable or a fixed energy unit.

   :scale:   40%

A colour may be added to specify the carrier of the energy unit like
gas (yellow), thermal (red), electricity (blue).

   :scale:   40%

Conversion units use the former representation inside a green box
as multi-carrier energy units. Have a look to the representation
for ElectricalToHeat and HeatPump energy units

Reversible units are represented as single units for simplicity
purpose, even if they do include a production unit and a consumption unit like
conversion units. The power flows of the production and consumption units in
the reversible unit are represented with double arrows, while storage
units' power flow is represented with a single arrow with a double head.
Finally, reversible conversion units are represented based on the former
graphical representations.

Representing all the energy unit
--------------------------------
In order to link the energy units, energy nodes and arrows should
be used. It is possible to highlight the variable which may
be optimised by the system or which is interesting for the user.

Finally, constraints and objectives can be added on the model
with the following representation

.. note:: This graph representation is not used yet as a graphical
    user interface but we hope that it will be in the near future.

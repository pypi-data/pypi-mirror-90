Energy flexibility features
===========================

To summarise the flexibility capabilities of Energy Units in OMEGAlpes:

- You can directly use the following parameters when creating an Energy Unit:

 - :py:function::`~omegalpes.energy.units.energy_units.min_time_on` / min_time_off: to define the minimum time the unit must be operating / not operating once started up / once switched off.
 - availability_hours: to define the number of hours the energy unit is available on the whole time horizon.
 - e_min: to set the minimal energy the unit must consume during the time horizon
 - e_max: to set the maximal energy the unit can consume during the time horizon
 - The ramp rates min_ramp_up, max_ramp_up, min_ramp_down, max_ramp_down:

- As a user you can also define a Shiftable Energy unit, you need to choose a power profile that can be shifted in time (so shorter in time than your time horizon, for instance a 2 hours power profile of a washing machine cycle compared to a 24 hours time horizon) and to define if the operation of the energy unit is mandatory or not.

- Finally, you can use the functions:

 - add_operating_time_range to define a range of hours during which the energy  unit can be operated every day.
 - add_energy_limits_on_time_period to define a minimal or maximal energy limit on a given time period of the studied horizon.

Installation:
=============


python-poppler-qt5 installs a single Python module named 'popplerqt5'.

The setup script uses distutils. Use the following commands to build and install
the module:

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

To install in /usr instead of /usr/local:

    python setup.py install --prefix /usr


You can also use the newer way of installing using pip:

    python -m pip install .


Troubleshooting:
================

The setup script uses pkg-config to determine the version of the installed
poppler-qt5 library. Methods or classes that are not in the installed poppler-
qt5 library will then also be disabled in the Python binding.

If your system does not provide pkg-config, you can manually specify the poppler
version to use with the --poppler-version option, e.g.:

python setup.py build_ext --poppler-version=0.14.0

Note that for these options to work you need the 'build_ext' command rather than
the 'build' command.

You may then also need the --include-dirs and --library-dirs options to the
build_ext command if the correct poppler-qt5 header files and libraries can't
be found.

See the output of

python setup.py --help build_ext

for more options.

If you have a Debian-based system such as Ubuntu, and you get the error
message "ImportError: No module named popplerqt5", try:

python setup.py install --install-layout=deb

See the distutils documentation for more install options.


Dependencies:
=============

- sip 4.9.1 or newer
- poppler-qt5 0.12.0 or newer (poppler-qt5 is part of poppler)
- Qt5
- PyQt5
- Python (tested with 2.6)

To build the popplerqt5 module, header files of Qt5 and poppler-qt5 and sip
files of PyQt5 are needed (sometimes packaged separately in corresponding -dev
packages).

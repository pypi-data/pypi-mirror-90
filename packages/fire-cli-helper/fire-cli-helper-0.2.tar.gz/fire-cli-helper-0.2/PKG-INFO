Description: # fire-commands
        Easy to use helper library for creating google fire based CLIs <br>
        https://github.com/google/python-fire <br>
        
        See example application firehelper_example for usage. <br>
        
        # CLI entry point
        In the CLI entry point, import relevant CLI commands, and use start_fire_cli initialise the fire app. <br>
        
        ```python
        import firehelper
        from .commands import *  #noqa
        
        def main():
            firehelper.start_fire_cli('firehelper_example')
        
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            main()
        ```
        
        # Commands
        
        Import each command in the main app to ensure code to register the command is run.<br>
        
        To register commands:
        ```python
        print_commands = {
            'print': lambda mytext: print(mytext) 
        }
        
        firehelper.CommandRegistry.register(print_commands)
        ```
        To register commands with subcommands:
        ```python
        maths_commands = {
            'maths': {
                'double': double,
                'square': square
            }
        }
        
        firehelper.CommandRegistry.register(maths_commands)
        ```
        You can import all commands within a module as follows:
        ```python
        # commands.__init__.py
        """Ensure all commands to be registered are referenced here."""
        
        __all__ = ['maths', 'print']
        ```
        ```python
        # __main__.py
        from commands import *  # noqa
        ```

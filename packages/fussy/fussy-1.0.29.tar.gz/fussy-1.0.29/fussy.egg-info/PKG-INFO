Description: Fussy Software Packager
        
        Fussy provides a collection of tools to create field-upgraded
        software installations. The installation uses a "pivot" root
        on your regular file system into which the current release of 
        your software is installed, and which can exist alongside a
        number of other versions of the software.
        
        It assumes a Linux-like operating system and requires certain
        linux services and utilities for many of its functions.
        
        Notable functionality:
        
        * GPG signed/verified firmware packing and unpacking
        * inotify support
        * non-blocking process IO (nbio)
        * transactional write operation
        * process control operations (e.g. kill-kill-kill)
        * simple structured log server
        * cron locks

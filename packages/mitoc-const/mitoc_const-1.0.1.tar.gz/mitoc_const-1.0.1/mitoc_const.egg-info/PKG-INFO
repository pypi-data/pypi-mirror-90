        # MITOC Constants
        This is a set of constants for use across MIT Outing Club infrastructure.
        
        MITOC has a number of projects, many of which reference values used
        in other databases or deployed projects. These projects may be deployed
        separately, so there's value in having shared values at constants in an
        external package.
        
        ## Releasing a new version
        It's recommended to keep the Python and TypeScript versions in lock-step.
        Even if no changes were made in one of the two, it's best to release both
        at the same time.
        
        ### pypi/Python
        First, augment the version in `setup.py`. Then:
        
        ```bash
        rm -rf dist/ build/ mitoc_const.egg-info/
        pipenv run python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        pipenv run twine upload dist/*
        git push origin master
        ```
        
        ### npm/TypeScript
        (Not used yet anywhere, an early prototype)
        ```bash
        npm run build
        npm publish
        ```
        
        
        ## TODO:
        - [ ] Add a Makefile for this project:
            - `make lint`, `make test`, and `make check`
            - `make push`
        - [ ] Black & isort
        - [ ] Run mypy as part of build check
        - [ ] Switch to poetry
        - [ ] Clean up the (unused) TypeScript package, verify for use
        - [ ] Automatically deploy after successful build

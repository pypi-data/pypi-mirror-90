        ## What's this?
        
        In many cases, I had to implement an object that needs to save stuff either 
        to the local fillesystem, or, depending on configuration, to a S3 instance. The provided
        module provides a single object that does exactly that: you initialize the object once, and 
        then, you can use the various functions that it provides such as:
        * ls
        * path_exists
        * rm
        * rmtree
        * ls
        * load_pickle, dump_pickle
        * load_json, dump_json
        
        
        ## Testing & Usave
        
        The packcage provides a set of unit tests that are located 
        in the `tests` directory. Read through these files to learn how the 
        module is used. In order to be able to run the tests, you have to create a
        `secret` folder in the directory of this README.md. Create a `confi.json` file in that
        folder that looks like this:
        
        
        ```json
        {
          "s3": {
            "defaultBucket": "bucket",
            "accessKey": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP",
            "accessSecret": "/accessSecretThatOnlyYouKnow"
          }
        }
        ```
        
        ## What does the name mean?
        In Hebrew, "shalosh" means "three". Thus, s-shalosh is s3.

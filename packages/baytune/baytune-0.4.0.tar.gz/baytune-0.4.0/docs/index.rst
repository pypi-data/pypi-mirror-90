Overview
========

* License: `MIT <https://github.com/MLBazaar/BTB/blob/master/LICENSE>`_
* Development Status: `Pre-Alpha <https://pypi.org/search/?c=Development+Status+%3A%3A+2+-+Pre-Alpha>`_
* Documentation: https://MLBazaar.github.io/BTB

BTB ("Bayesian Tuning and Bandits") is a simple, extensible backend for developing auto-tuning
systems such as AutoML systems. It provides an easy-to-use interface for *tuning* and *selection*.

It is currently being used in several AutoML systems:

* `ATM <https://github.com/HDI-Project/ATM>`_, distributed, multi-tenant AutoML system for
  classifier tuning
* `mit-d3m-ta2 <https://github.com/HDI-Project/mit-d3m-ta2/>`_, MIT's system for the DARPA
  `Data-driven discovery of models <https://www.darpa.mil/program/data-driven-discovery-of-models>`_ (D3M) program
* `AutoBazaar <https://github.com/MLBazaar/AutoBazaar>`_, a flexible, general-purpose
  AutoML system

History
-------

In its first iteration, in 2018, BTB was designed as an open source library that handles
the problems of tuning the hyperparameters of a machine learning pipeline, selecting
between multiple pipelines and recommending a pipeline. A good reference to see our design
rationale at that time is Laura Gustafsonâ€™s thesis, written under the supervision of
Kalyan Veeramachaneni:

* `Bayesian Tuning and Bandits`_.
  Laura Gustafson. Masters thesis, MIT EECS, 2018.

Later in 2018, Carles Sala joined the project to make it grow as a reliable open-source library
that would become part of a bigger software ecosystem designed to facilitate the development of
robust end-to-end solutions based on Machine Learning tools. This second iteration of our work
was presented in 2019 as part of the Machine Learning Bazaar:

* `The Machine Learning Bazaar: Harnessing the ML Ecosystem for Effective System Development`_.

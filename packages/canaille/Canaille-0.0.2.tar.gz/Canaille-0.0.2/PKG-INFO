        **Canaille** is a French word meaning *rascal*. It is roughly pronounced **Can I?**,
        as in *Can I access your data?* Canaille is a simple OpenID Connect provider based upon a LDAP database.
        
        It aims to be very light, simple to install and simple to maintain. Its main features are :
        - Authentication and user profile edition against a LDAP directory;
        - OpenID Connect support;
        - No outdated or exotic protocol support;
        - No additional database required. Everything is stored in your LDAP server;
        - The code is easy to read and easy to edit.

	"TaskDescription": "On each trial (inter-trial interval (ITI) varied between 8 s and 14 s; mean ITI=12 s),participants used one of two buttons on a response pad to indicate the direction of a central arrow in an array of 5 arrows. In congruent trials the flanking arrows pointed in the same direction as the central arrow (e.g., < < < < <), while in more demanding incongruent trials the flanking arrows pointed in the opposite direction (e.g., < < > < <). Subjects performed two 5-minute blocks, each containing 12 congruent and 12 incongruent trials, presented in a pseudorandom order.",

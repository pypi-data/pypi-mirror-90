The pyAFQ configuration file
----------------------------

This file should be a `toml <https://github.com/toml-lang/toml>`_ file. At
minimum, the file should contain information about the location of the
`dmriprep` folder::

    [files]
    dmriprep_folder = '/path/to/study/derivatives/dmriprep'


But additional configuration options can be provided.
See an example configuration file below::

    title = "My AFQ analysis"

"""

pyAFQ will store a copy of the configuration file alongside the computed
results. Note that the `title` variable and `[metadata]` section are both for
users to enter any title/metadata they would like and pyAFQ will generally
ignore them.

        *Here* is the `Kivy <https://kivy.org>`_ based app to run Python code from the `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_ magic %there.
        
        - *Here* is a server part with the GUI interface. It could be Android, Raspberry Pi, some other remote device that being debugged.
        - And *%there* is a client - Jupyter magic command to run code interactively on remote device.

        Install on Android
        ------------------
        
        Ready-to-use *PythonHere* APKs are available in the `Releases <https://github.com/b3b/pythonhere/releases>`_ section.
        
        For a list of installed Python packages, see: `buildozer.spec <./buildozer.spec>`_.
        
        
        Quick Start with Docker
        -----------------------
        
        Docker image is based on `Jupyter Docker Stacks <https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, and includes installed *PythonHere* with usage examples.
        
        Example command to start the Docker container::
        
            docker run \
                   --rm \
                   -p 8888:8888 \
                   -v "$(pwd)/work":/home/jovyan/work \
                   herethere/pythonhere:latest
        
        
        Command will expose the Jupyter Notebook server on host port 8888. Jupyter logs appear in the terminal and include an URL to the notebook server: http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=... . Visiting this URL in a browser loads the Jupyter Notebook dashboard page.
        
        Files from the directory **work** inside container, will be available in the host directory with the same name: **work**.
        
        
        Run with Docker Compose
        -----------------------
        
        Commands to run with Docker Compose, in the source directory:::
        
          cp docker-compose.yml.tmpl docker-compose.yml
          docker-compose up
        
        
        Run locally
        -----------
        
        Commands to run locally::
        
           pip install pythonhere
           jupyter notebook start
        
        
        Build Android app
        -----------------
        
        To build with `Buildozer <https://github.com/kivy/buildozer>`_, run in the source directory::
        
        
          buildozer android debug

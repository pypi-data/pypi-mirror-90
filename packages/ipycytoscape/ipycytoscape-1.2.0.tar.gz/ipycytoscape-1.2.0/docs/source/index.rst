ipycytoscape
============

Version: |release|

Visualize graphs using `Cytoscape.js <https://js.cytoscape.org/>`_ in a Jupyter Notebook. You
can either create graphs using the ipycytoscape API or create them from:

- `NetworkX <https://networkx.github.io/>`_
- JSON
- `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ Dataframes


Quickstart
----------

To get started with ipycytoscape, install with pip::

    pip install ipycytoscape

or with conda/`mamba <https://github.com/TheSnakePit/mamba>`_::

    conda install -c conda-forge ipycytoscape
    # or with mamba
    mamba install -c conda-forge ipycytoscape

If you are using JupyterLab 1.x or 2.x you will also need to follow the instructions in :ref:`jlab-install-instructions`.

Simple Example
--------------

.. jupyter-execute::

   from ipycytoscape import CytoscapeWidget
   import networkx as nx
   G = nx.complete_graph(5)
   cyto = CytoscapeWidget()
   cyto.graph.add_graph_from_networkx(G)
   display(cyto)

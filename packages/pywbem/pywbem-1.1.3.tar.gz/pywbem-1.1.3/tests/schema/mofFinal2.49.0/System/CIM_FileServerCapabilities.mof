          "Method to create a set of supported SettingData "
          "elements, from two sets of SettingData elements, "
          "provided by the caller. \n"
          "CreateGoalSettings should be used when the SettingData "
          "instances that represents the goal will not persist "
          "beyond the execution of the client and where those "
          "instances are not intended to be shared with other, "
          "non-cooperating clients. \n"
          "Both TemplateGoalSettings and SupportedGoalSettings are "
          "arrays of elements that are strings containing "
          "EmbeddedInstances of a CIM_SettingData subclass. These "
          "embedded instances do not exist in the infrastructure "
          "supporting this method but are maintained by the "
          "caller/client. \n"
          "This method should return CIM_Error(s) representing that "
          "a single named property of a setting (or other) "
          "parameter (either reference or embedded object) has an "
          "invalid value or that an invalid combination of named "
          "properties of a setting (or other) parameter (either "
          "reference or embedded object) has been requested. \n"
          "If the input TemplateGoalSettings is NULL or the empty "
          "string, this method returns a default SettingData "
          "element that is supported by this Capabilities element. \n"
          "If the TemplateGoalSettings specifies values that cannot "
          "be supported, this method shall return an appropriate "
          "CIM_Error and should return a best match for a "
          "SupportedGoalSettings. \n"
          "The client proposes a goal using the "
          "TemplateGoalSettings parameter and gets back Success if "
          "the TemplateGoalSettings is exactly supportable. It gets "
          "back \"Alternative Proposed\" if the output "
          "SupportedGoalSettings represents a supported "
          "alternative. This alternative should be a best match, as "
          "defined by the implementation. \n"
          "If the implementation is conformant to a "
          "RegisteredProfile, then that profile may specify the "
          "algorithms used to determine best match. A client may "
          "compare the returned value of each property against the "

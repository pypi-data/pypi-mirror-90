    Description ( 
       "LocallyAccessibleFileSystemCapabilities specifies the "
       "combination of properties that a File Server ComputerSystem "
       "(ComputerSystem.Dedicated=16) can support for accessing a "
       "LocalFileSystem. The LocallyAccessibleFileSystemCapabilities "
       "element is associated to the FileSystemConfigurationService "
       "via ElementCapabilities and to the File Server ComputerSystem "
       "via ScopedCapabilities. The supported combination of "
       "properties is specified by LocallyAccessibleFileSystemSetting "
       "elements that are associated with the "
       "LocallyAccessibleFileSystemCapabilities element via "
       "SettingsDefineCapabilities. These "
       "LocallyAccessibleFileSystemSettings must be derived from "
       "ScopedSettingData and scoped via ScopedSetting to the same "
       "File Server ComputerSystem as the LocallyAccessibleFileSystemCapabilities.\n"
       "The LocallyAccessibleFileSystemCapabilities element specifies "
       "the attributes of LocallyAccessibleFileSystemSetting that it "
       "can support in its SupportedProperties property. \n"
       "This class also provides a CreateGoalSettings method that "
       "isused to create a LocallyAccessibleFileSystemSetting element "
       "to be used as a goal when making a FileSystem locally "
       "accessible to the ComputerSystem. The goal is used as a "
       "parameter to the "
       "FileSystemConfigurationService.CreateFileSystem and "
       "FileSystemConfigurationService.ModifyFileSystem methods. If "
       "the methods are succesful, a clone of the goal is created that "
       "is associated with the FileSystem via ElementSettingData and "
       "scoped to the File Server ComputerSystem via ScopedSetting." )]

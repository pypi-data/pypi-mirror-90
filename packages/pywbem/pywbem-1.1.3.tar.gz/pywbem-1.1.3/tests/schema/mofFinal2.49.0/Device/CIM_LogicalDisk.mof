       "A LogicalDisk is a presentation of a contiguous range of "
       "logical blocks that is identifiable by applications such as "
       "filesystems via the Name field. (DeviceID (key) may use the "
       "same name or some other unique text such as a UUID.) For "
       "example in a Windows environment, the Name field may contain a "
       "drive letter. In a Unix environment, it may contain the access "
       "path (for example, \'/dev/...\'); and in a NetWare "
       "environment, may contain the volume name. LogicalDisks are "
       "typically built on a DiskPartition or other LogicalDisks (for "
       "instance, those exposed by a software volume manager). "
       "However, it can be based on other StorageExtents, like "
       "CIM_Memory, in the case of a RAM disk. \n"

    Description ( 
       "This service defines the Protect method used to apply and "
       "modify the protection setting for a specified StorageVolume or "
       "LogicalDisk. The settings applied are used to protect a "
       "storage element from accidental or intentional overwriting. "
       "Accordingly, the settings set the read/write ability of the "
       "element, SCSI inquiry visibility, whether it can be copied "
       "over, and whether it can be exposed from the storage system. "
       "This service also allows the specification of a retention "
       "time, or length of time that these settings cannot be "
       "modified. The settings remain in effect after this time period "
       "expires until changed. The values of this setting are stored "
       "in the StorageProtectionSetting class associated to the "
       "StorageVolume pr LogicalDisk via ElementProtectionSettingData. "
       "The StorageProtectionSetting cannot be modified directly, but "
       "can only be modified via this service. While the element is "
       "being protected, the StorageProtectionSetting cannot be "
       "removed." )]

          "Within the scope of the instantiating Namespace, "
          "InstanceID opaquely and uniquely identifies an instance "
          "of this class. To ensure uniqueness within the "
          "NameSpace, the value of InstanceID should be constructed "
          "using the following \'preferred\' algorithm: \n"
          "<OrgID>:<LocalID> \n"
          "Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon "
          "\':\', and where <OrgID> must include a unique name. It "
          "can be a copyrighted, trademarked, or otherwise unique "
          "name that is owned by the business entity that is "
          "creating or defining the InstanceID. Or, it could be a "
          "registered ID that is assigned to the business entity by "
          "a recognized global authority.(This requirement is "
          "similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name>> structure of "
          "Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness "
          "<OrgID> must not contain a colon (\':\'). When using "
          "this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID "
          "must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. \n"
          "<LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should "
          "not be re-used to identify different underlying "
          "(real-world) elements. If the above \'preferred\' "
          "algorithm is not used, the defining entity must ensure "
          "that the resulting InstanceID is not re-used as any of "
          "InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for the "
          "NameSpace of this instance. \n"
          "For DMTF-defined instances, the \'preferred\' algorithm "
          "must be used with the <OrgID> set to \'CIM\'." )]

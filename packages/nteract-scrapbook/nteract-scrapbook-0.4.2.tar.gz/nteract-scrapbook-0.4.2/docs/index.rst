**scrapbook** is a library for recording a notebookâ€™s data values and
generated visual content as "scraps". These recorded scraps can be read
at a future time.

This library replaces `papermill <https://papermill.readthedocs.io>`_'s existing
`record` functionality.

Python Version Support
----------------------

This library will support python 2.7 and 3.5+ until end-of-life for
python 2 in 2020. After which python 2 support will halt and only 3.x
version will be maintained.

Use Case
--------

Notebook users may wish to record data produced during a notebook
execution. This recorded data can then be read to be used at a later
time or be passed to another notebook as input.

Namely scrapbook lets you:

-  **persist** data and displays (scraps) in a notebook
-  **recall** any persisted scrap of data
-  **summarize collections** of notebooks

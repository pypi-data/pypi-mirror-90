Description: Incenp.Bioutils - Incenp.org’s utilities for computational biology
        ==================================================================
        
        Incenp.Bioutils is a set of command line utilities and helper Python
        modules to deal with some computational biology tasks.
        
        
        Utilities
        ---------
        
        ### SeqTool
        
        *SeqTool* is intended as a “Swiss Army knife” to perform various
        operations on biological sequence files.
        
        Among other things, it provides wrappers for the `blast` and `dotter`
        alignment tools; the main interest of those wrappers is that they can be
        used with sequences in any format supported by Biopython’s SeqIO module,
        whereas the original tools only read files in the FASTA format.
        
        
        ### SeqVault
        
        *SeqVault* is a command-line interface to [BioSQL](https://biosql.org/)
        databases.
        
        *SeqVault* is intended to be used with a slightly modified version of the
        BioSQL database schema (provided in the `biosql` directory), where every
        `biodatabase` is associated with a 3-letters prefix. That prefix is then
        used to automatically assign accession numbers (of the form `PRE_xxxxxx`
        where `PRE` is the prefix) when importing sequences into the database.
        However *SeqVault* can also be used with pristine BioSQL databases.
        
        
        #### Quickstart (example with PostgreSQL)
        Create a new PostgreSQL user account and a new database::
        
            # createuser <username>
            # createdb -O owner <username> <dbname>
            
        Initialize the newly created database by running the provided
        `biosql/biosqldb-pg.sql` script::
        
            $ psql -h localhost -U <username> <dbname> < biosql/biosqldb-pg.sql
            
        Next, create a plaintext file in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bioutils/databases.ini`
        and fill it as follows::
        
            [Server]
            host: localhost
            user: <username>
            password: <PostgreSQL user password>
            database: <dbname>
            
        *SeqVault* is now ready to be used.
        
        
        ### cc3d-runner
        
        *CC3d-Runner* is a small wrapper around the command-line interface of
        [CompuCell3D](https://compucell3d.org/), to run headless simulations.
        
        
        Helper modules
        --------------
        The main helper module is the `incenp.bio.seq.usa` module, which
        provides an implementation of the [Uniform Sequence Address format
        ](https://emboss.sourceforge.net/docs/themes/UniformSequenceAddress.html).
        
        A Uniform Sequence Address or USA is a way to refer to a biological
        sequence and to fetch that sequence from its source.
        
        The following example shows how to read a sequence specified by a USA::
        
            from incenp.bio.seq import usa
            
            records = usa.read_usa('genbank::file.gb:acc:X65923')
            
        The returned `records` object is an array of `Bio.SeqRecord.SeqRecord`
        objects.    
        
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        The following Python packages are necessary:
        
        - [Biopython](https://biopython.org/),
        
        - [Click](https://palletsprojects.com/p/click/),
        
        - [Click-Shell](https://github.com/clarkperkins/click-shell).
        
        [ReportLab](http://www.reportlab.com/) is required to run the `plasmm`
        subcommand of the `seqtool` utility.
        
        The `seqvault` utility requires a SQL adapter for the database server
        you plan to use it with, such as [psycopg2](https://psycopg.org/) for
        PostgreSQL.

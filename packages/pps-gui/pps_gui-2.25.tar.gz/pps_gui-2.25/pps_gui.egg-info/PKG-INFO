Description: # pps_gui
        The emulator code to be imported into a student's program.  Works with the pps_gui simulator package.  Together, they give a student an environment where they can get readings from a simulated hardware device, maybe like a Raspberry Pi, maybe not.  Either way, students will have access to check for button pushes (4 buttons), turn LED lights on / off (red, yellow, green, and blue), detect light / dark, several sliders for temperature, humidity and pressure, and finally, they can ring an incredibly obnoxious buzzer. This application is based on work by primeteacher.

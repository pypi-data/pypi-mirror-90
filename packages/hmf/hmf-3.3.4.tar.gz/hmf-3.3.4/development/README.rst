This directory houses several scripts/notebooks aiding the development of aspects of ``hmf``.

As such, they may grow stale with time, having served a purpose for older versions etc. They are not really meant to be "examples" of usage of the code,
but they may be able to serve that purpose in some cases. They often focus on things like choosing correct limits/resolution for certain parameters, which
could be useful for some applications.

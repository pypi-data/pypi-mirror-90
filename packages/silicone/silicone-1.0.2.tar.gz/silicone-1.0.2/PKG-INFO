Description: Silicone
        ========

        Silicone is a Python package which can be used to infer emissions from other emissions data.
        It is intended to 'infill' integrated assessment model (IAM) data so that their scenarios
        quantify more climate-relevant emissions than are natively reported by the IAMs themselves.
        It does this by comparing the incomplete emissions set to complete data from other sources.
        It uses the relationships within the complete data to make informed infilling estimates of
        otherwise missing emissions timeseries.
        For example, it can add emissions of aerosol precurors based on carbon dioxide emissions
        and infill nitrous oxide emissions based on methane, or split HFC emissions pathways into
        emissions of different specific HFC gases.

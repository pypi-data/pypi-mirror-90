Python 3 package for solving the inverse maximum entropy problem with a focus on
the pairwise maximum entropy model, also known as the inverse Ising problem.

See GitHub page for overview on package use and extensions. Directions for
massive speed up of Metropolis sampling with C++ are also available there.

Examples are included in the Jupyter notebook "usage_guide.ipynb" and the Python
script "usage_guide.py" (see GitHub). An overview for version 1 is also
published in the
[paper](https://github.com/eltrompetero/coniii/blob/py3/guide/guide.pdf).

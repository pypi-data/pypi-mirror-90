Pyserini provides a simple Python interface to the [Anserini](http://anserini.io/) IR toolkit via [pyjnius](https://github.com/kivy/pyjnius).

A low-effort way to try out Pyserini is to look at our [online notebooks](https://github.com/castorini/anserini-notebooks), which will allow you to get started with just a few clicks.
For convenience, we've pre-built a few common indexes, available to download [here](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/jimmylin/anserini-indexes).

Pyserini versions adopt the convention of _X.Y.Z.W_, where _X.Y.Z_ tracks the version of Anserini, and _W_ is used to distinguish different releases on the Python end.
The current stable release of Pyserini is [v0.10.1.0](https://pypi.org/project/pyserini/) on PyPI.
The current experimental release of Pyserini on TestPyPI is behind the current stable release (i.e., do not use).
In general, documentation is kept up to date with the latest code in the repo.

If you're looking to work with the [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research), start with [this guide](docs/working-with-cord19.md).

## Package Installation

Install via PyPI:

```
pip install pyserini==0.10.1.0
```

## Development Installation

If you're planning on just _using_ Pyserini, then the `pip` instructions above are fine.
However, if you're planning on contributing to the codebase or want to work with the latest not-yet-released features, you'll need a development installation.
For this, clone our repo with the `--recurse-submodules` option to make sure the `tools/` submodule also gets cloned.

The `tools/` directory, which contains evaluation tools and scripts, is actually [this repo](https://github.com/castorini/anserini-tools), integrated as a [Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) (so that it can be shared across related projects).
Build as follows (you might get warnings, but okay to ignore):

```bash
cd tools/eval && tar xvfz trec_eval.9.0.4.tar.gz && cd trec_eval.9.0.4 && make && cd ../../..
cd tools/eval/ndeval && make && cd ../../..
```

Next, you'll need to clone and build [Anserini](http://anserini.io/).
It makes sense to put both `pyserini/` and `anserini/` in a common folder.
After you've successfully built Anserini, copy the fatjar, which will be `target/anserini-X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT-fatjar.jar` into `pyserini/resources/jars/`.
You can confirm everything is working by running the unit tests:

```bash
python -m unittest
```

Assuming all tests pass, you should be ready to go!

## How do I search?

The `SimpleSearcher` class provides the entry point for searching.
Anserini supports a number of pre-built indexes for common collections that it'll automatically download for you and store in `~/.cache/pyserini/indexes/`.
Here's one on TREC Disks 4 &amp; 5, used in the [TREC 2004 Robust Track](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/regressions-robust04.md):

```python
from pyserini.search import SimpleSearcher

searcher = SimpleSearcher.from_prebuilt_index('robust04')
hits = searcher.search('hubble space telescope')

# Print the first 10 hits:
for i in range(0, 10):
    print(f'{i+1:2} {hits[i].docid:15} {hits[i].score:.5f}')
```

The results should be as follows:

```
 1 LA071090-0047   16.85690
 2 FT934-5418      16.75630
 3 FT921-7107      16.68290
 4 LA052890-0021   16.37390
 5 LA070990-0052   16.36460
 6 LA062990-0180   16.19260
 7 LA070890-0154   16.15610
 8 FT934-2516      16.08950
 9 LA041090-0148   16.08810
10 FT944-128       16.01920
```

To further examine the results:

```
# Grab the raw text:
hits[0].raw

# Grab the raw Lucene Document:
hits[0].lucene_document
```

Configure BM25 parameters and use RM3 query expansion:

```python
searcher.set_bm25(0.9, 0.4)
searcher.set_rm3(10, 10, 0.5)

hits2 = searcher.search('hubble space telescope')

# Print the first 10 hits:
for i in range(0, 10):
    print(f'{i+1:2} {hits2[i].docid:15} {hits2[i].score:.5f}')
```

More generally, `SimpleSearcher` can be initialized with a location to an index.
For example, you can download the same pre-built index as above by hand:

```bash
wget https://git.uwaterloo.ca/jimmylin/anserini-indexes/raw/master/index-robust04-20191213.tar.gz
tar xvfz index-robust04-20191213.tar.gz -C indexes
rm index-robust04-20191213.tar.gz
```

And initialize `SimpleSearcher` as follows:

```python
searcher = SimpleSearcher('indexes/index-robust04-20191213/')
```

The result will be exactly the same.

Pre-built Anserini indexes are hosted at the University of Waterloo's [GitLab](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/jimmylin/anserini-indexes) and mirrored on Dropbox.
The following method will list available pre-built indexes:

```
SimpleSearcher.list_prebuilt_indexes()
```

A description of what's available can be found [here](docs/prebuilt-indexes.md).

## How do I fetch a document?

The other commonly used feature is to fetch a document given its `docid`.
This is easy to do:

```python
doc = searcher.doc('LA071090-0047')
```

From `doc`, you can access its `contents` as well as its `raw` representation.
The `contents` hold the representation of what's actually indexed; the `raw` representation is usually the original "raw document".
A simple example can illustrate this distinction: for an article from CORD-19, `raw` holds the complete JSON of the article, which obviously includes the article contents, but has metadata and other information as well.
The `contents` are extracts from the article that's actually indexed (for example, the title and abstract).
In most cases, `contents` can be deterministically reconstructed from the `raw`.
When building the index, we specify flags to store `contents` and/or `raw`; it's rarely the case we store both, since it's usually a waste of space.
In the case of the pre-built `robust04` index, we only store `raw`.
Thus:

```python
# Document contents: what's actually indexed.
# Note, this is not stored in the pre-built robust04 index.
doc.contents()
                                                                                                   
# Raw document
doc.raw()
```

As you'd expected, `doc.id()` returns the `docid`, which is `LA071090-0047` in this case.
Finally, `doc.lucene_document()` returns the underlying Lucene `Document` (i.e., a Java object).
With that, you get direct access to the complete Lucene API for manipulating documents.

Every document has a `docid`, of type string, assigned by the collection it is part of.
In addition, Lucene assigns each document a unique internal id (confusingly, Lucene also calls this the `docid`), which is an integer numbered sequentially starting from zero to one less than the number of documents in the index.
This can be a source of confusion but the meaning is usually clear from context.
Where there may be ambiguity, we refer to the external collection `docid` and Lucene's internal `docid` to be explicit.
Programmatically, the two are distinguished by type: the first is a string and the second is an integer.

As an important side note, Lucene's internal `docid`s are _not_ stable across different index instances.
That is, in two different index instances of the same collection, Lucene is likely to have assigned different internal `docid`s for the same document.
This is because the internal `docid`s are assigned based on document ingestion order; this will vary due to thread interleaving during indexing (which is usually performed on multiple threads).

The `doc` method in `searcher` takes either a string (interpreted as an external collection `docid`) or an integer (interpreted as Lucene's internal `docid`) and returns the corresponding document.
Thus, a simple way to iterate through all documents in the collection (and for example, print out its external collection `docid`) is as follows:

```python
for i in range(searcher.num_docs):
    print(searcher.doc(i).docid())
```

## How do I search my own documents?

Pyserini (via Anserini) provides ingestors for document collections in many different formats.
The simplest, however, is the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "id": "doc1",
  "contents": "this is the contents."
}
```

A document is simply comprised of two fields, a `docid` and `contents`.
Pyserini accepts collections comprised of these documents organized in three different ways:

+ Folder with each JSON in its own file, like [this](integrations/resources/sample_collection_json).
+ Folder with files, each of which contains an array of JSON documents, like [this](integrations/resources/sample_collection_json_array).
+ Folder with files, each of which contains a JSON on an individual line, like [this](integrations/resources/sample_collection_jsonl) (often called JSONL format).

So, the quickest way to get started is to write a script that converts your documents into the above format.
Then, you can invoke the indexer (here, we're indexing JSONL, but any of the other formats work as well):

```bash
python -m pyserini.index -collection JsonCollection -generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
 -threads 1 -input integrations/resources/sample_collection_jsonl \
 -index indexes/sample_collection_jsonl -storePositions -storeDocvectors -storeRaw
```

Once this is done, you can use `SimpleSearcher` to search the index:

```python
from pyserini.search import SimpleSearcher

searcher = SimpleSearcher('indexes/sample_collection_jsonl')
hits = searcher.search('document')

for i in range(len(hits)):
    print(f'{i+1:2} {hits[i].docid:15} {hits[i].score:.5f}')
```

You can also add extra fields in your documents when needed, e.g. text features.
For example, the [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#named-entities) Named Entity Recognition (NER) result of `contents` could be stored as an additional field `NER`.

```json
{
  "id": "doc1",
  "contents": "Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion.",
  "NER": {
            "ORG": ["Apple"],
            "GPE": ["U.K."],
            "MONEY": ["$1 billion"]
         }
}
```

Happy honking!

## Known Issues

Anserini is designed to work with JDK 11.
There was a JRE path change above JDK 9 that breaks pyjnius 1.2.0, as documented in [this issue](https://github.com/kivy/pyjnius/issues/304), also reported in Anserini [here](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/issues/832) and [here](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/issues/805).
This issue was fixed with pyjnius 1.2.1 (released December 2019).
The previous error was documented in [this notebook](https://github.com/castorini/anserini-notebooks/blob/master/pyjnius_demo.ipynb) and [this notebook](https://github.com/castorini/anserini-notebooks/blob/master/pyjnius_demo_jvm_issue_fix.ipynb) documents the fix.

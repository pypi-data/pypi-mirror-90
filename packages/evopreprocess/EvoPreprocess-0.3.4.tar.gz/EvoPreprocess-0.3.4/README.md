# EvoPreprocess

EvoPreprocess is a Python toolkit for sampling datasets, instance weighting, and feature selection. It is compatible with [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [imbalanced-learn](https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). It is based on [NiaPy](https://github.com/NiaOrg/NiaPy) library for the implementation of nature-inspired algorithms and is distributed under GNU General Public License v3.0 license.

## Data sampling

### Simple data sampling example

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from EvoPreprocess.data_sampling import EvoSampling

# Load classification data
dataset = load_breast_cancer()

# Print the size of dataset
print(dataset.data.shape, len(dataset.target))

# Sample instances of dataset with default settings with EvoSampling
X_resampled, y_resampled = EvoSampling().fit_resample(dataset.data, dataset.target)

# Print the size of dataset after sampling
print(X_resampled.shape, len(y_resampled))
```

### Data sampling for regression with custom nature-inspired algorithm and other custom settings

```python
import NiaPy.algorithms.basic as nia
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from EvoPreprocess.data_sampling import EvoSampling

# Load regression data
dataset = load_boston()

# Print the size of dataset
print(dataset.data.shape, len(dataset.target))

# Sample instances of dataset with custom settings and regression with EvoSampling
X_resampled, y_resampled = EvoSampling(
	evaluator=DecisionTreeRegressor(),
	evo_algorithm=nia.EvolutionStrategyMpL,
	n_folds=5,
	n_runs=5,
	n_jobs=4
).fit_resample(dataset.data, dataset.target)

# Print the size of dataset after sampling
print(X_resampled.shape, len(y_resampled))
```

### Data sampling with scikit-learn

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from EvoPreprocess.data_sampling import EvoSampling

# Set the random seed for the reproducibility
random_seed = 1111

# Load classification data
dataset = load_breast_cancer()

# Split the dataset to training and testing set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(dataset.data, dataset.target,
                                                    test_size=0.33,
                                                    random_state=random_seed)

# Train the decision tree model
cls = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=random_seed)
cls.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Print the results: shape of the original dataset and the accuracy of decision tree classifier on original data
print(X_train.shape, accuracy_score(y_test, cls.predict(X_test)), sep=': ')

# Sample the data with random_seed set
evo = EvoSampling(n_folds=3, random_seed=random_seed)
X_resampled, y_resampled = evo.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)

# Fit the decision tree model
cls.fit(X_resampled, y_resampled)

# Print the results: shape of the original dataset and the accuracy of decision tree classifier on original data
print(X_resampled.shape, accuracy_score(y_test, cls.predict(X_test)), sep=': ')
```

## Instance weighting

### Simple instance weighting example

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from EvoPreprocess.data_weighting import EvoWeighting

# Load classification data
dataset = load_breast_cancer()

# Get weights for the instances
instance_weights = EvoWeighting().reweight(dataset.data, dataset.target)

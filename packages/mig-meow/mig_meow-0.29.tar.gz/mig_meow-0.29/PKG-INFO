Description: # mig_meow
        MEOW is a Manager for Event Oriented Workflows.
        
        ## Introduction
        mig_meow provides a way for MEOW Workflows to be defined using Patterns and 
        Recipes. These can be sent to the MiG 
        (https://sourceforge.net/projects/migrid/), which is used for actual job 
        processing and data storage.
        
        Currently this package does very little on its own.
        
        ## Installation
        mig_meow can be installed from pypi using pip using:
        ```
        pip install mig_meow
        ```
        
        ## Jupyter
        mig_meow is designed primarily to be used within Jupyter notebooks, either as a
        standard notebook or within Jupyter Lab. If you are running it within Jupyter 
        Lab it will require the labextensions:
        
        - jupyterlab-manager (https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets)
        - bqplot (https://github.com/bqplot/bqplot)
        
        ## Examples
        Some example patterns and recipes are included in the 'examples' directory. 
        These can be worked through in the 'workflow_examples.ipynb' notebook.
        
        ## Testing
        Automatic testing is available though it will require a numpy install to work 
        correctly.

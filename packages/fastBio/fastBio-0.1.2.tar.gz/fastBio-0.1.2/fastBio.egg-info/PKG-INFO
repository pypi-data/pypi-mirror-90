Description: # Welcome to fastBio
        
        fastBio is a library for manipulating data and creating and training deep learning models for biological sequencing data. It is an extension of the fastai v1 library.
        
        A number of pretrained models for biological sequencing data - a universal language model as well as several downstream transfer learning tasks - can be loaded with the fastBio LookingGlass and LookingGlassClassifier classes. These models are available for download at the sister repository LookingGlass: https://github.com/ahoarfrost/LookingGlass

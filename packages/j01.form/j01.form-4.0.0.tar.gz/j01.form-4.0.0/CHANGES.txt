2.4.2 (2018-03-15)
------------------

- feature: added showNoValueItem option for RadioWidget. This option allows to
  render an additional "No value" item for select None as value. This can get
  enabled if the schema defines required=False. If schema required=True is
  defined, you need to add None as valid value to your source or vocabulary
  and adjust the schema messing_value to something else then None for make
  None a valid value. By default, the showNoValueItem is set to False and
  forces not rendering "No value" as option for not required fields.

- feature: added structure to widget description. This allows to render
  html as widget description. Take care if you do some wired things with
  the widget and render custom user input in the widget description. Because
  this whould not be safe and could lead in a cross site injection. But normaly
  this is save if you control the translation process and only render schema
  field description as widget description.


2.4.1 (2018-02-15)
------------------

- feature: added bootstrap 3 DateTimePickerWidget. This widget is available if
  the j01.datetimepicker package is installed


2.4.0 (2017-09-18)
------------------

- bugfix: make sure we don't apply widget changes for widgets defined in
  widgetIgnoreContexts in applyChanges method

- bugfix: adjust ignoreRequiredOnValidations implementation. use new
  J01FieldWidgets and make sure that the ignoreRequiredOnValidation will not
  get override by the default FieldWidgets ignoreRequiredOnExtract attribute

- security: remove structure for widget label in checkbox widget and
  widget layout template. Make sure widget label can't get used for a
  script injection. This is only relevant if you implement persistent
  widgets or the translator provides unsecure code.

- feature: implemented custom FieldWidgets (J01FieldWidgets) which reflects
  the form field/widget conditions like widgetRequireds, widgetIgnoreRequests,
  ignoreRequiredOnValidations

- feature: implemented widgetIgnoreApplyChanges and customized applyChanges
  method which is able to ignore apply data handling for fields defined
  in widgetIgnoreApplyChanges. This is usefull if a field should get ignored
  in applyChanges because we handled them with a different button handler


2.3.0 (2017-06-29)
------------------

- feature: added contentRenderMethodName for rendering the response content
  based on additional javascript methods

- bugfix: fix broken select_display.pt tal markup


2.2.0 (2017-01-11)
------------------

- feature: implemented getLabel method in checkbox widget. This allows use to
  render enhanced labels including links and more. This is usefull for custom
  single checkbox widgets e.g. render a href link to the AGB etc.

- bugfix: fix ignoreRequest setup. Since there is no concept for apply the
  ignoreRequest value per field, we need to apply the ignoreRequest value
  on the widget. But since the widget update call will setup the widget and
  also call the widget update method, we need to apply the ignoreRequest
  value after this widget update call and call the update method again.
  Since the ignoreRequest per field/widget concept was broken, we also changed
  the applyIgnoreRequest to applyWidgetIgnoreRequest.

- reorganize less files and support better support for reuse the files in other
  projects. The generated css files and original less files provide the same
  code as before. We just added another indirection and moved the real less
  code to a folder called source and removed every include in this source
  files.

  css class mixins in page and forms.

  filled widgets

  was called.

  css class. The form-control class is used as marker for twitter bootstrap 3
  form fields/controls. This makes it simple to use with twitter bootstrap 3 but
  could also get used with your own css styles. The j01.form package also
  provides a radio/checkbox widget using overlay icons and styles for
  rendering nicer radio and checkbox controls. Other enhanced widgets provide
  nicer select and multi select rendering.

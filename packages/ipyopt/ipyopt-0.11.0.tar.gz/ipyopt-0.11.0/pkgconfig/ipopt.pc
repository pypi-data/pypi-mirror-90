# When I installed Ipopt from source, I used the
# --prefix=/usr/local
# option, so this is where I want ipyopt to look for my ipopt installation.
# I only installed from source because the ipopt packaging
# for my linux distribution was buggy,
# so by the time you read this the bugs have probably been fixed
# and you will want to specify a different directory here.

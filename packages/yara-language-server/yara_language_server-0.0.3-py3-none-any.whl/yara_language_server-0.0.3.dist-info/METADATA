Description: # YARA Language Server
        
        ![build_badge](https://github.com/ch0mler/yara-language-server/workflows/build/badge.svg)
        
        An implementation of the Language Server Protocol for the YARA pattern-matching language.
        
        ## Features
        
        ### Code Completion
        
        Provides completion suggestions for standard YARA modules, including `pe`, `elf`, `math`, and all the others available in the official documentation: http://yara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules.html
        
        ### Diagnostics
        
        The extension will compile workspace rules in the background and return errors and warnings as you type.
        
        ### Definition Provider and Peeking
        
        Allows peeking and Ctrl+clicking to jump to a rule definition. This applies to both rule names and variables.
        
        ### Formatter Provider
        
        Reformats YARA rules using the [plyara](https://github.com/plyara/plyara) library.
        
        ### Hover Provider
        
        Allows viewing a variable's value by hovering over it in the condition rule. Does not work for wildcards.
        
        ### Reference Provider
        
        Shows the locations of a given symbol (rule name, variable, constant, etc.).
        
        ### Rename Provider
        
        Allows user to rename a symbol within a rule without manually changing every instance of that symbol.
        
        ## Requirements
        Python 3.7 or higher is required due to the heavy use of the `asyncio` library and specific APIs available only since v3.7.
        
        If `plyara` is installed, documents can be automatically re-formatted according to the package's `rebuild_yara_rule` utility.
        
        In addition, `yara-python` should be installed. If it is not installed, Diagnostics and Compile commands will not be available.
        
        **Note:** If you are on Windows, you might have to set the `$INCLUDE` environment variable before building this environment, so that when `yara-python` is compiled for your local system, Python knows where to find the appropriate DLLs.
        On Windows 10, this would probably look like:
        ```sh
        set INCLUDE="C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Include" && python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

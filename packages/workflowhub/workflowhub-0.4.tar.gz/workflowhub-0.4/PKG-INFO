        <br/>_A Community Framework for Enabling Scientific Workflow Research and Development_
        
        This Python package provides a collection of tools for:
        
        - Analyzing traces of actual workflow executions;
        - Producing recipes structures for creating workflow recipes for workflow generation; and
        - Generating synthetic realistic workflow traces.
        
        ## Installation
        
        WorkflowHub is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/workflowhub).
        WorkflowHub requires Python3.6+ and has been tested on Linux and macOS.
        
        ### Requirements
        
        #### Graphviz
        WorkflowHub uses _pygraphviz_ and thus needs the graphviz package installed (version 2.16 or later).
        You can install graphviz easily on Linux with your favorite package manager,
        for example for Debian-based distributions:
        ```
        sudo apt-get install graphviz libgraphviz-dev
        ```
        and for RedHat-based distributions:
        ```
        sudo yum install python-devel graphviz-devel
        ```
        
        On macOS you can use `brew` package manager:
        ```
        brew install graphviz
        ```
        
        ### Installation using pip
        
        While `pip` can be used to install WorkflowHub, we suggest the following
        approach for reliable installation when many Python environments are available:
        
        ```
        $ python3 -m pip install workflowhub
        ```
        
        ### Retrieving the latest unstable version
        
        If you want to use the latest WorkflowHub unstable version, that will contain
        brand new features (but also contain bugs as the stabilization work is still
        underway), you may consider retrieving the latest unstable version.
        
        Cloning from [WorkflowHub's GitHub](https://github.com/workflowhub/workflowhub)
        repository:
        
        ```
        $ git clone https://github.com/workflowhub/workflowhub
        $ cd workflowhub
        $ pip install .
        ```

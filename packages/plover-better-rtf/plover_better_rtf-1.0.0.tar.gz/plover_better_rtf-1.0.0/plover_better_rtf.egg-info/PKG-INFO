Description: # Plover Better RTF
        
        Plover plugin for better RTF dictionary handling. Powered by
        [rtfcre](https://github.com/sammdot/rtfcre).
        
        Unfortunately, I can't find a way to override Plover's built-in RTF dictionary
        plugin, so for now your RTF dictionaries will have to be named `.rtfcre` if you
        want to use this plugin.

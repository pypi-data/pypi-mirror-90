        `Kytos SDN Platform <https://kytos.io>`_ is the fastest way to deploy an SDN
        Network. With this you can deploy a basic OpenFlow controller or your own
        controller. Kytos was designed to be easy to install, use, develop and share
        Network Apps (NApps). Kytos is incredibly powerful and easy, its modular design
        makes Kytos a lightweight SDN Platform.
        
        Kytos is conceived to ease SDN controllers development and deployment. It was
        motivated by some gaps left by common SDN solutions. Moreover, it has strong
        tights with a community view, so it is centered on the development of
        applications by its users. Thus, our intention is not only to build a new SDN
        solution, but also to build a community of developers around it, creating new
        applications that benefit from the SDN paradigm.
        
        The project was born in 2014 and has been under active development since
        2016.

description: >
  Example DIALS scaled data, of four sweeps of l-cysteine scaled together,
  which were then split into datafiles containing two sweeps and two
  datafiles containing one sweep each. Scaled using dials master branch
  version 3d17bb2 on 18/07/19. Generated from dials integrated data,
  known as xia2-28 in the dials_regression repository. Originally derived
  from data collected on I19-1 at Diamond Light Source, U.K.

  Useful input for testing dials programs post-scaling.

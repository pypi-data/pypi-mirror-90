        **YGOPRODECK API Wrapper**
        
        ## Installation
        
        You can install it with pip3:
        
            pip3 install yugioh
        
        ## Usage
        
        I'm currently still building this project. Monster cards are supported, spell/trap cards are not.
        
        ```python3
            from yugioh import yugioh
            
            card = yugioh(card_name = "The Wicked Dreadroot")
            print(card.name) #Returns "The Wicked Dreadroot"
            print(card.archetype) #Returns "Wicked God"
            print(card.atk) #Returns "4000"
        ```
        
        # Attributes

Purpose
-------

django-next-prev provides utilities to get the next or previous item
within an ordered, filtered queryset. For example, you could display a
link to the next featured post on a post detail page, or show
chronological next and previous links for all published posts.

Installation
------------

Download the source from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-next-prev/
and run ``python setup.py install``, or:

::

   > pip install django-next-prev

Django 1.8 or higher is required.

Quick start
-----------

Given this models.py:

.. code:: python

   from django.db import models

   class Category(models.Model):
       title = models.CharField(max_length=100)

   class Post(models.Model):
       title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
       category = models.ForeignKey(Category, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
       created = models.DateField()
       featured = models.BooleanField(default=False)
       text = models.TextField()

       class Meta:
           # order on primary key to make sure it's unique
           ordering = ('created', 'title', 'pk')

You can do the following

.. code:: python

   from next_prev import next_in_order, prev_in_order
   from .models import Post

   # default ordering
   first = Post.objects.first()
   second = next_in_order(first)
   prev_in_order(second) == first # True
   last = prev_in_order(first, loop=True)

   # custom ordering
   qs = Post.objects.all().order_by('-created', '-pk')
   newest = qs.first()
   second_newest = next_in_order(newest, qs=qs)
   oldest = prev_in_order(newest, qs=qs, loop=True)

   # filtered
   qs = Post.objects.filter(featured=True)
   first_featured = qs.first()
   second_featured = next_in_order(first_featured, qs=qs)

Ordering considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Order fields must be non-nullable.

If results are inconsistent with the order of your queryset, youâ€™re
probably ordering on a non-unique combination of fields. For example,
``ordering = ('sort_order', )`` with the duplicate ``sort_order``
values. To resolve this, add a unique field to your ordering, i.e.
``ordering = ('sort_order', 'pk')``

![Badge showing number of monthly downloads from PyPI.](https://pepy.tech/badge/pyfabrik/month)

![Badge showing that code has been formated with Black formatter.](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)

Python 3 implementation of
[FABRIK](http://www.andreasaristidou.com/FABRIK.html) (Forward And
Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics).
## Installation

    pip install pyfabrik

## Usage

**NOTE: API is still very unstable (until the 1.0 release). Suggestions are welcome.**

```python

import pyfabrik
from vectormath import Vector3

initial_joint_positions = [Vector3(0, 0, 0), Vector3(10, 0, 0), Vector3(20, 0, 0)]
tolerance = 0.01

# Initialize the Fabrik class (Fabrik, Fabrik2D or Fabrik3D)
fab = pyfabrik.Fabrik3D(initial_joint_positions, tolerance)

fab.move_to(Vector3(20, 0, 0))
fab.angles_deg # Holds [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

fab.move_to(Vector3(60, 60, 0)) # Return 249 as number of iterations executed
fab.angles_deg # Holds [43.187653094161064, 3.622882738369357, 0.0]
```

Description: # General information
        
        **oclock** is a Python 3 module that provides timing tools :
        
        - The `Timer()` class allows for cancellable loops of constant duration.
        
        - The `countdown()` function is a GUI countdown timer based on the Timer class.
        
        - The `parse_time()` function returns a (hours, min, sec) tuple from a time string (e.g. `':2:25'`)
        
        - The `measure_time()` function is a context manager that measures the average time (unix time) and time uncertainty (+/- dt) at which the encapsulated commands occur.
        
        
        
        # Quick start
        
        ## Install
        
        ```bash
        pip install oclock
        ```
        
        ## Cancellable timer for constant-duration loops
        
        The most basic use of the `Timer()` class in Python code to create a loop of constant duration is:
        ```python
        from oclock import Timer
        timer = Timer(interval=2)  # Loops will be of total duration 2 seconds
        while condition:
            my_function()  # can be of any duration between 0 and 2 seconds
            timer.checkpt()
        ```
        The `checkpt()` method waits the adequate amount of time to make the loop of constant duration, without drift.
        
        Note that if *my_function()* takes longer to execute than the required time interval, the Timer class does not try to compensate the extra time by making the next loop shorter. It just aims at making the total duration of the next loop be the requested interval again.
        
        The timer is also modifiable (change time interval) and cancellable in real time (i.e. even when the timer is in a `checkpt()` waiting phase). To do so, it must be accessed by another thread that runs concurrently. For example:
        
        ```python
        from oclock import Timer
        from threading import Thread, Event
        
        
        def user_input(exit_event, timer):
            """Command line input to change the time interval of the timer or exit."""
            while not exit_event.is_set():
                a = input()
                try:
                    dt = float(a)
                except ValueError:  # immediately cancel timer & exit all loops/threads
                    timer.deactivate()
                    exit_event.set()
                else:               # immediately change interval do input value
                    timer.interval = dt
        
        
        timer = Timer(interval=2)
        exit_event = Event()
        
        # CLI to interact with timer
        Thread(target=user_input, args=(exit_event, timer)).start()
        
        while not exit_event.is_set():
            my_function()
            timer.checkpt()
        ```
        
        See example.py for a more detailed, working example. The program can be started with `python -m example` (e.g. from the root of the *oclock* repository)
        
        Also see *Timer Class details* section below for all methods, properties and attributes and for accuracy information.
        
        ## Countdown GUI
        
        A simple graphical countdown timer based on the `Timer` class. It can be used either as a python main program from a shell, or as a function in Python code or console:
        
        From a terminal:
        ```bash
        python -m oclock 1:45:00   # start timer of duration 1 hour 45 minutes
        python -m oclock 1:45:     # exactly the same as above
        python -m oclock 00:02:00  # start 2-minute timer
        python -m oclock :2:       # exactly the same as above
        python -m oclock 00:00:05  # start 5-second timer
        python -m oclock ::5       # exactly the same as above
        ```
        
        In python:
        ```python
        from oclock import countdown
        countdown('1:45:')         # start timer of duration 1 hour 45 minutes
        ```
        (the inputs are of the same format as from the terminal, see above).
        
        When countdown is finished, 'Done' is displayed for 5 seconds in the GUI while the console displays *Countdown finished* and emits a sound (if available) 5 times in a row. Then the time passed since the end of countdown is displayed as a negative value in red. The program stops when the GUI window is closed.
        
        ## Parse time function
        
        The `parse_time()` function is used in the argument parsing of the countdown GUI from a terminal (see above). It transforms a string in the form `'h:m:s'` into a `datetime.timedelta` object. Inputs of the form e.g. `'::5'` or `:2:`, `'3:30:'` are acceptable for 5 seconds, 2 minutes, and 3.5 hours, respectively.
        ```python
        >>> parse_time(':2:30')
        datetime.timedelta(seconds=150)
        ```
        
        ## Context manager to record timing of commands
        
        The `measure_time()` function is a context manager that saves the timing info of the encapsulated commands. This can be e.g. used in scientific experiments to get the time and time uncertainty associated with a measurement.
        ```python
        from oclock import measure_time
        
        # Example where one just wants to get timing info ----------------------------
        with measure_time() as timing:
            my_function()
        print(timing)
        # Out: {'time (unix)': 1604780958.0705943, 'dt (s)': 0.6218999624252319}
        
        # Example where the timing info is directly added to a data dictionary -------
        with measure_time() as data:
            measurement = my_function()  # returns e.g. 3.618
            data['measurement'] = measurement
        print(data)
        # Out: {'measurement': 3.618,
        #       'time (unix)': 1604780958.0705943,
        #       'dt (s)': 0.6218999624252319}
        ```
        
        
        # `Timer` Class details
        
        ## Methods
        
        ```python
        timer.checkpt()  # Checkpoint for constant-duration loops, see above
        timer.reset()  # starts counting time from here
        timer.deactivate()  # immediate exiting of timer (see notes below)
        timer.pause()  # Simply pauses the elapsed time, but does not act on checkpt()
        timer.resume()  # restarts the elapsed time counter after pause()
        ```
        
        ## Properties (settable)
        
        ```python
        timer.interval       # get interval (in s)
        timer.interval += 1  # increase interval by 1 second
        timer.interval = 10  # set interval to 10 seconds.
        
        timer.warnings          # get current status of warnings
        timer.warnings = True   # activate warnings if time between checkpts too short
        
        timer.name  # optional name to give to the timer with timer=Timer(name='xyz')
        timer.name = 'Countdown timer'  # can also be set during instantiation
        ```
        
        ## Attributes (read-only)
        
        ```python
        # Most useful attributes
        timer.elapsed_time  # Time in seconds since init or last reset
        timer.pause_time    # total time (in s) the timer has been paused.
        
        # Other (moslty internal to module methods)
        timer.init_time     # Unix time at which the timer object has been intantiated
        timer.start_time    # Unix time since last reset (or init if no reset made)
        timer.interval_exceeded  # (bool) True if the contents of the loop take longerto execute than the current requested interval
        timer.target  # (float) unix time of the target time for the next loop
        timer.stop_event  # (threading.Event object): is set when timer is deactivated
        ```
        
        ## Notes
        
        - Methods take effect immediately, even if the timer is in a waiting phase, which can be useful if the loop is controlled by an external signal.
        
        - A change in `timer.interval` also takes effect immediately (any checkpt() that is in effect is cancelled), but does not reset the timer: in particular, `elapsed_time()` is not reset to zero.
        
        - After deactivation, the `timer.checkpt()` command becomes equivalent to a `pass`, so that all following lines will be executed immediately and without any waiting time (i.e. as fast as possible if within a loop), until `timer.reset()` is called again.
        
        
        ## Accuracy test
        
        See *performance.py* file of the module for functions to test the accuracy of the timer. In particular:
        ```python
        from oclock.performance import performance_test
        performance_test(dt=0.1, nloops=100, fmax=0.99)
        ```
        tests the timing on 100 loops of requested duration 0.1 second, using within the loop a function sleeping for a random amount of time between 0 and 0.99*dt (use `plot=True` option to see the results on a matplotlib graph)
        
        Below are some quick preliminary results on timing accuracy in an Unix Environment (MacOS) and Windows, using `n=1000`, `fmax=0.99` for various values of `dt`.
        
        - **Unix timing accuracy**
        
        |     Requested dt (s)    |   1    | 0.1  | 0.04  | 0.01 | 0.001 |
        |:-----------------------:|:------:|:----:|:-----:|:----:|:-----:|
        |Relative error in dt (%)*|< 0.0001|< 0.01| < 0.1 | 3.5  |  12   |
        |Fluctuations in dt (ms)**|   0.6  | 0.5  |   1   |  1   |  0.2  |
        
        
        - **Windows timing accuracy**
        
        |     Requested dt (s)    |   1   |  0.1  | 0.04 | 0.01 | 0.001 |
        |:-----------------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:----:|:----:|:-----:|
        |Relative error in dt (%)*|< 0.002|  0.9  | 6.1  |  62  |  833  |
        |Fluctuations in dt (ms)**|  6.5  |  7.8  | 7.7  |  6.4 |  3.2  |
        
        (*) measured by averaging all individual loop durations and comparing to the requested dt
        (**) using one standard deviation
        
        
        # Development
        
        Package requirements to run the tests:
        - pytest
        - numpy
        
        General testing is done with *pytest* (from the root of the repository):
        ```bash
        pytest
        ```
        (**Note**: close the interactive countdown window at the end of the pytest run to finish the test.)
        
        Additional testing can be done by running the example file from the root of the repository.
        ```bash
        python -m example
        ```
        
        See *Accuracy Test* paragraph above to run performance tests for constant-duration loops with the `Timer` class.
        
        Pull requests must be submitted with commits in branch *authors*.
        
        # Requirements
        
        Python >= 3.6
        (but could be easily changed to work with all python 3.x versions by removing f-strings)

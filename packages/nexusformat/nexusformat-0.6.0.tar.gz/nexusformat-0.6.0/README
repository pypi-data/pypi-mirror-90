Introduction
============
This package provides a Python API to open, create, and manipulate NeXus 
data <http://www.nexusformat.org/> written in the HDF5 format. It also includes 
a remote file server to allow files to be opened across a network. The 
'nexusformat' package provides the underlying API for NeXpy
<http://nexpy.github.io/nexpy>, which provides a GUI interface for
visualizing and analyzing NeXus data.

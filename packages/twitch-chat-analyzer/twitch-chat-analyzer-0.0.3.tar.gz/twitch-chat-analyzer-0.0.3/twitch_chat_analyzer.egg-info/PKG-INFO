Description: # twitch-chat-analyzer-py
        
        Twitch chat analyzer from past broadcasts, designed for Jupyter notebook.
        
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        ### Installation
        
        The package can be installed by ```pip``` command in terminal 
        
        ```pip install --upgrade twitch-chat-analyzer```
        
        ### Run Jupyter Notebook
        
        The package is mainly intended to be used in Jupyter notebook, but it can still be used in standard Python environment
        
        Instruction to install Jupyter notebook (or newer JupyterLab) is [here](https://jupyter.org/install)
        
        After installation, run the following command in terminal to start Jupyter
        
        ```jupyter notebook``` or ```jupyter-lab```
        
        ### Download chats from past broadcast
        
        notebook.ipynb has examples of statistics functions. 
        
        ```python
        from twitch_chat_analyzer import analyzer
        
        # Create an analyzer object from video ID.
        # If the chat log was not downloaded before, it will download automatically and create an analyzer.
        ann = analyzer.FromVideoId('REPLACE_HERE_TO_VIDEO_ID')
        
        # Some pre-built statistics functions to draw graph
        ann.DrawChatPerMinutes(10)  # Chat counts for each 10-minute interval
        ann.DrawTopChatters(20)  # Top 20 viewers with most chats
        ann.DrawTopEmotes(15)  # Top 15 most used emotes
        
        # If you want to handle dataframe yourself
        df = ann.ToDataFrame()
        ```
        
        ### DataFrame
        
        The dataframe returned from ToDataFrame() has the following columns
        
        | Column name | type | meaning |
        | :---------: | :--: | :-----: |
        | offset | float | Time of the chat, in seconds after stream started |

#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is the blacklist file. Each package listed here may not be
# installed be upgraded be find or deleted.
# NOTE: The settings here affect all repositories.
#
# To blacklist the package 'wicd-1.7.2.4-x86_64-4.txz' the line will be:
# wicd
#
# To blacklist packages that start with name add * the end of the name:
# kernel*
#
#
# Sometimes the automatic kernel update creates problems because you
# may need to file intervention 'lilo'. The slpkg automatically detects
# if the core has been upgraded and running 'lilo'. If you want to avoid
# any problems uncomment the lines below.

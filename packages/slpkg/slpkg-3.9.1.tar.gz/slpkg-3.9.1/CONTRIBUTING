Contributions are very much appreciated !!!

Pull requests should be based on and submitted to the "develop" branch

It would be preferable to have a basic knowledge about the distribution Slackware,
as important how a package is build.

Small changes in the code each time more appreciated.
Keep the style code applicable items.

Please ensure your changes work in Python >= 3.7

Built-for-purpose, minimal 2D graphics library.

Working on documentation, but the file [examples/jamboree.py](https://github.com/aforren1/mglg/blob/master/examples/jamboree.py) is pretty comprehensive.

To pre-create the glyphs and atlas, there's a command line tool, e.g.:

```bash
python -m mglg.util.prebake_font examples\UbuntuMono-B.ttf fonts\
```

Which saves a pickled file (in this case, `fonts\UbuntuMono-B.pklfont`) that includes the atlas, glyphs, and other info to avoid touching the font file. Add `--view` to see the atlas.

`freetype-py` is required to generate pickled fonts or do on-the-fly font loading, and can be installed either via `pip install freetype-py` or `pip install mglg[freetype]`.

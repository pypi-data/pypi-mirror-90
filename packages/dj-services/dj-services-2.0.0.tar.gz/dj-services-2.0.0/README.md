Thanks to this library, you can build your business logic in beautiful
services, not in huge views and fat models.

## Getting Started

Install this library using `pip`

```
$ pip install dj-services
```

Create `services.py` module in your Django app and create your first service

```python
# services.py
from djservices import CRUDService

from .models import MyModel
from .forms import MyForm


class MyService(CRUDService):
    model = MyModel
    form = MyForm
```

After that you can use this service in `views.py`

```python
# views.py
from django.shortcuts import render

from .services import MyService


def list_entries(request):
    service = MyService()
    entries = service.get_all()
    return render(request, 'some_template.html', {'entries': entries})
```

That's all. Now you can add business logic in your service. Let's go!

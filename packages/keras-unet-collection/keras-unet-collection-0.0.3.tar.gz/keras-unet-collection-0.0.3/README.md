# Overview

U-net is a convolutional neural network with encoder-decoder architecture and skip-connections, loosely defined under the concept of "fully convolutional networks." U-net was originally proposed for the semantic segmentation of medical images and is modified for solving a wider range of gridded learning problems.

U-net and many of its variants take three or four-dimensional tensors as inputs and produce outputs of the same shape. One technical highlight of these models is the skip-connections from downsampling to upsampling layers that benefit the reconstruction of high-resolution, gridded outputs.

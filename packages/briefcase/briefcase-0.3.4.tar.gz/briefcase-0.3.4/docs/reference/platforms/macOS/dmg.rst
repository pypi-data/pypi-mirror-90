It presents itself to the operating system a disk that can be mounted; the
image then contains the files being distributed. For this reason, DMGs are
often used for distributing new applications, especially when there

Briefcase's DMG support is an extension of ``.app`` bundle support. The DMG
created by Briefcase contains a ``.app`` bundle for the application, plus a
symbolic link to the user's ``/Applications`` folder; this enables the user to
install their application by mounting the DMG, and dragging the application's
icon onto the icon for the ``/Applications`` folder contained in the DMG.
A background image can be provided to provide an additional visual hint for
the installation action.

Icon format
===========

macOS DMGs use ``.icns`` format icons for the application and installer.

Splash Image format
===================

macOS DMGs do not support splash screens.

The installer background must be in ``.png`` format.

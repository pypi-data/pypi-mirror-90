Description: # differentiable robot model
        Differentiable and learnable robot model. Our differentiable robot model implements computations such as 
        forward kinematics and inverse dynamics, in a fully differentiable way. We also allow to specify  
        parameters (kinematics or dynamics parameters), which can then be identified from data (see examples folder).
        
        Currently, our code should work with any kinematic chain (eg any 7-DOF manipulator should work). It's been tested 
        and evaluated particularly for the Kuka iiwa.
        
        
        ## Setup
        ```
        conda create -n robot_model python=3.7
        conda activate robot_model
        python setup.py develop
        ```
        Note that the data files might not be found if the setup is not run with `develop` (Fixme)
        
        ## Examples
        2 examples scripts show the learning of kinematics parameters
        ```
        python examples/learn_kinematics_of_iiwa.py
        ```
        
        and the learning of dynamics parameters
        ```
        python examples/learn_dynamics_of_iiwa.py
        ```
        
        ## L4DC paper and experiments
        the notebook `experiments/l4dc-sim-experiments` shows a set of experiments that are similar to what we presented 
        in our L4DC paper
        
        ```

        ## Testing
        running `pytest` in the top-level folder will run our differentiable robot model tests, 
        which compare computations against pybullet.

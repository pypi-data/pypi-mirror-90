![PyPI - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/imucal)

This package provides methods to calculate and apply calibrations for IMUs based on multiple different methods.

So far supported are:

- Ferraris Calibration (Ferraris1995)
- Ferraris Calibration using a Turntable

## Installation

```
pip install imucal
```

To use the included calibration GUI you also need matplotlib (version >2.2).
You can install it using:

```
pip install imucal[calplot]
```

## Calibrations

### Ferraris

This package implements the IMU-infield calibration based on Ferraris1995.
This calibration methods requires the IMU data from 6 static positions (3 axis parallel and antiparallel to gravitation vector) and 3 rotations around the 3 main axis.
In this implementation these parts are referred to as follows `{acc,gry}_{x,y,z}_{p,a}` for the static regions and `{acc,gry}_{x,y,z}_rot` for the rotations.
As example, `acc_y_a` would be the 3D-acceleration data measured during a static phase, where the **y-axis** was oriented **antiparallel** to the gravitation.

#### Creating a new Calibration Object

If the data of all of these sections is already available separately as numpy arrays of the shape `(n x 3)`, where `n` is the number of samples in each section, they can be directly used to initialize a Calibration object:

```python
from imucal import FerrarisCalibration

sampling_rate = 100 #Hz 
cal = FerrarisCalibration(sampling_rate=sampling_rate,
                          acc_x_p=data_acc_x_p,
                          ...,
                          gyr_z_rot=data_gyr_x_rot)
```
or via class variables:
```python
from imucal import FerrarisCalibration

sampling_rate = 100 #Hz 
cal = FerrarisCalibration(sampling_rate=sampling_rate)
cal.gyr_z_a = data_gyr_z_a
...
```

If the data was recorded as a single continuous stream, we first need to identify the different regions in the data.
The `from_interactive_plot` method can be used to extract them manually using a GUI.
For this and for most other methods, we expect the data to be a `pd.DataFrame` with the columns `'acc_x', 'acc_y', 'acc_z, 'gyr_x', 'gyr_y', 'gyr_z'`, where each column represents the datastream of one sensor axis.

Note: The expected column names can be overwritten

```python
from imucal import FerrarisCalibration

sampling_rate = 100 #Hz 
# This will open an interactive plot, where you can select the start and the stop sample of each region
cal, section_list = FerrarisCalibration.from_interactive_plot(data, sampling_rate=sampling_rate)

section_list.to_csv('./calibration_sections.csv')  # This is optional, but recommended
```

This method also returns the `section_list` in addition to the Calibration object.
It is advised to save this list, as it can be used recreate the Calibration without performing the manual selection of the regions again:

```python
# At some other day:
from imucal import FerrarisCalibration
import pandas as pd

section_list = pd.read_csv('./calibration_sections.csv', index_col=0)
sampling_rate = 100 #Hz 
# This will recreate the calibration
cal = FerrarisCalibration.from_section_list(data, section_list, sampling_rate=sampling_rate)
```

#### Performing the Calibration

When the calibration object was successful initialized, you can obtain the calibration by simply calling `compute_calibration_matrix`:

```python
cal_mat = cal.compute_calibration_matrix()
print(cal_mat)
```

This will return an `FerrarisCalibrationInfo` object, which holds all required calibration information.
This object can be saved and loaded to and from `hdf5` and `json` using the respective methods:

```python
cal_mat.to_json_file('./calibration.json')
# some other day:
from imucal import FerrarisCalibrationInfo

cal_mat = FerrarisCalibrationInfo.from_json_file('./calibration.json') 
```

```python
cal_mat.to_hdf5('./calibration.h5')
# some other day:
from imucal import FerrarisCalibrationInfo

cal_mat = FerrarisCalibrationInfo.from_hdf5('./calibration.h5') 
```

#### Applying the Calibration

The `FerrarisCalibrationInfo` object can be used to apply the Calibration to new data from the same sensor:

```python
calibrated_acc, calibrated_gyro = cal_mat.calibrate(acc, gyro)
```

`acc` and `gyro` are expected to be numpy arrays in the shape (n x 3)


### Turntable Calibration

The turntable calibration uses some sort of instumeted turntable to perform the orientation changes and rotations for the Ferraris calibration.
It is fundamentally identical to the simple Ferraris calibration, however to indicate the expected difference in precision, this calibration method is implemented as seperate classes.
The interface is identical to the Ferraris calibration and all methods shown above can be used.

**Note**: By default the Turntable calibration expects 720 deg rotations instead of 360 deg

```python
# obtain the calibration
from imucal import TurntableCalibration

sampling_rate = 100 #Hz 
# This will open an interactive plot, where you can select the start and the stop sample of each region
cal, section_list = TurntableCalibration.from_interactive_plot(data, sampling_rate=sampling_rate)
cal_mat = cal.compute_calibration_matrix()
cal_mat.to_json_file('./calibration.json')

# Apply the calibration
from imucal import TurntableCalibrationInfo

cal_mat = TurntableCalibrationInfo.from_json_file('./calibration.json') 

calibrated_acc, calibrated_gyro = cal_mat.calibrate(acc, gyro)
```

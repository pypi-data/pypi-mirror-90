        Tired of learning new frameworks and just need something to quickly display your docstrings in your python files? You've come to the right place. Epythet is built on
         [Sphinx Python Documentation Generator](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) but automatically generates pages for each module .py files and a table of contents.

kb is a python package for rapidly pre-processing single-cell RNA-seq data. It is a wrapper for the methods described in

Melsted, Booeshaghi et al., Modular and efficient pre-processing of single-cell RNA-seq, bioRxiv, 2019

The goal of the wrapper is to simplify downloading and running of the kallisto [1] and bustools [2] programs. It was inspired by Sten Linnarsson’s loompy fromfq command (http://linnarssonlab.org/loompy/kallisto/index.html)

The kb program consists of two parts:

The `kb ref` command builds or downloads a species-specific index for pseudoalignment of reads. This command must be run prior to `kb count`, and it runs the `kallisto index` [1].

The `kb count` command runs the kallisto [1] and bustools [2] programs. It can be used for pre-processing of data from a variety of single-cell RNA-seq technologies, and for a number of different workflows (e.g. production of gene count matrices, RNA velocity analyses, etc.). The output can be saved in a variety of formats including mix and loom. Examples are provided below.

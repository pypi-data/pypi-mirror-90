***This project is still in early stages, much is still to come.***

## Description:
`selprotopy` is intended to be used as a protocol binding suite for the SEL Protocol
suite which includes SEL Fast Meter, SEL Fast Message, and SEL Fast Operate; each of
which are proprietary protocols designed by
[Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories](https://selinc.com/) for use primarily with
protective electric relays, and other intelligent electronic devices.

## Protocol Documentation:
SEL Protocol was introduced in the early 1990s to support various communications and
control of SEL protective relays. SEL provided a very supportive
[application guide](https://selinc.com/api/download/5026/?lang=en) which provides great
detail about the protocol's implementation.

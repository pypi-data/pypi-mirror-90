# Publish: A Bibliographic Reference System

## Overview

Publish may be used for handling publication lists for research
institutions and departments, or for individual researchers. Publish
imports publication metadata (title, author, year of publication etc),
validates the imported data against a database of known venues, checks
for missing attributes, corrects common errors etc, and allows simple
filtering and generation of publication lists.

For further information, refer to the Publish User Manual available in
the subdirectory doc/manual/ of this source tree.

## Installation

Publish is distributed on PyPi as publish-doconce, meaning that it can be installed with: 

```
pip install publish-doconce
```

To install Publish from this repository, simply type
```
python setup.py install
```

## Dependencies:

This version of Publish requires Python 3.6. Publish is not supported but probably still works on Python >= 2.6 (only tested for 2.7) with the levenshtein, future, and lxml modules installed:

```
pip install python-Levenshtein
pip install future
pip install lxml
```

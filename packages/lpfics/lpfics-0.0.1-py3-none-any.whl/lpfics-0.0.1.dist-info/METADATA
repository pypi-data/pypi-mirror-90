LPFICS Lib to find incompatible constraints set in Linear Problems
================================================================

LPFICS Idea
-----------
**Objective**: This project aims to enable to find ONE incompatible constraint set if a 
model is considered infeasible once resolved.
Note that it MAY NOT be the ONLY ONE set of constraints making your problem infeasible.

This project is based on PuLP (https://github.com/coin-or/pulp) a LP modeler written 
in Python. PuLP integrates the solver CBC. This solution works with CBC, and GLPK solvers
but does not work with Gurobi (as the output is always NotSolved and not Infeasible if 
the problem is overconstrainted).


Here is a simplified explaination:
If a problem is overconstrainted, the problem will:
- test to solve the problem with the first half of the constraints
    - if there is no solution it continues taking the first half (of the half) 
    of the constraints
    - if there is a solution, it will test the other half
        - if the second half has no solution it will continue dividing the second half
        set of constraints to test it
        - if the second half has a solution it will rearrange the constraints and 
        test again

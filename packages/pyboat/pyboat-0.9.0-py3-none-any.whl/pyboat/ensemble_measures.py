    '''
    Compute the power distribution of an ensemble
    of (ridge-)analyzed signals.

    Central measure is the time-averaged ridge-power of individual
    signals.

    Parameters
    ----------

    ridge_results : sequence of DataFrames,
                   holds the ridge data for the individual signals.
                   Check pyboat.core.eval_ridge for details
                   about the DataFrame structure
    
    signal_ids : sequence, optional 
                 labels of the analyzed signals, if not given
                 a numeric sequence of len(ridge_results)
                 will be used as labels

    exclude_coi :  bool, if True only average the ridge outside of the COI,
                  for short noisy trajectories there might be no such points!

    Returns
    -------
    power_series : pandas Series with the signal_ids as index 
                   and averaged powers as values

    '''
    Aggregate all the ridge-readouts (period, amplitude and phase)
    of a ridge-analyzed signal ensemble and return time-continuous median and
    quartiles (as in a time-continuous box plot).
    In the case of phase return the 1st order parameter 
    (length of resultant vector) 
    as a phase coherence measure over time.

    Signals/ridge-readouts of unequal length in time are Ok! 

    Parameters
    ----------

    ridge_results : sequence (or iterable) of DataFrames
                    holding the ridge data for the individual signals

    Returns
    --------

    A tuple holding 4 data frames, one summary statistic over time
    for period, amplitude, power and phase each.

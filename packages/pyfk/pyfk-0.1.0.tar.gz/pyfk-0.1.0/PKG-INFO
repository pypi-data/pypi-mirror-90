        About
        -------------
        
        ðŸš¨ **This package is still undergoing rapid development.** ðŸš¨
        
        Pyfk is the python version of `FK <http://www.eas.slu.edu/People/LZhu/home.html>`__ used to calculate the Green's function and the synthetic waveforms for the 1D Earth model.
        
        Pyfk has mainly provided functions as:
        
        * compute the Green's function for the explosion, single force, and double couple source using the frequency-wavenumber method.
        * compute the static displacements and corresponding Green's function.
        * compute the synthetic waveforms by convolving the Green's function with the seismic source.
        * have a close integration with Obspy, and is naturally to process the waveforms using this package.
        
        and it has the features as:
        
        * all the code is written in pure python, and it's compatible with Linux and Mac at the moment. The Windows is not supported, as i am 
          using the complex number in Cython, which will use the C99 standard of "complex.h" that has not been supported by the Visual Studio compiler.
        * it uses Cython to speed up the computationally expensive part (mainly the wavenumber integration).
        * a complete test has been performed to ensure pyfk has the same result as FK.

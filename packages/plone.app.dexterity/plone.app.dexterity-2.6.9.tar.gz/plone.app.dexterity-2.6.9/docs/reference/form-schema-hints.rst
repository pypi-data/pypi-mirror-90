Form Configuration with Schema Hints using Directives
=====================================================

Dexterity uses the directives in `plone.autoform <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.autoform>`_ and `plone.supermodel <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.supermodel>`_ package to configure its `z3c.form <http://docs.zope.org/z3c.form>`_-based add and edit forms.
A directive annotates a schema with “form hints”, which are used to configure the form when it gets generated from the schema.

The easiest way to apply form hints in Python code is to use the directives from `plone.autoform <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.autoform>`_ and `plone.supermodel <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.supermodel>`_.
For the directives to work, the schema must derive from *plone.supermodel.model.Schema*.

Directives can be placed anywhere in the class body (annotations are made directly on the class).
By convention they are kept next to the fields they apply to.

For example, here is a schema that omits a field:

.. code-block:: python

    from plone.autoform import directives
    from plone.supermodel import model
    from zope import schema


    class ISampleSchema(model.Schema):

        title = schema.TextLine(title=u'Title')

        directives.omitted('additionalInfo')
        additionalInfo = schema.Bytes()

The form directives are taking parameters in the form of a list of field names,
or a set of field name/value pairs as keyword arguments.
Each directive can be used zero or more times.

There are two kinds of directives:

- appearance related directives
- security related directives


Appearance Related Directives
------------------------------

*plone.autoform.directives* provides these:

================= ======================================================================================================
Name              Description
================= ======================================================================================================
widget            Specify an alternate widget for a field.
                  Pass the field name as a key and a widget as the value.
                  The widget can either be a z3c.form widget instance or a string giving the dotted name to one.
omitted           Omit one or more fields from forms. Takes a sequence of field names as parameters.
mode              Set the widget mode for one or more fields.
                  Pass the field name as a key and the string ‘input’, ‘display’ or ‘hidden’ as the value.
order\_before     Specify that a given field should be rendered before another.
                  Fields can only be ordered if they are in the same fieldset,
                  otherwise order directive is ignored.
                  Pass the field name as a key and name of the other field as a value.
                  If the other field is in a supplementary schema (i.e. one from a behavior),
                  its name will be e.g. ``IOtherSchema.other_field_name``.
                  If the other field is from the same schema,
                  its name can be abbreviated by a leading dot e.g. ``.other_field_name``.
                  If the other field is is used without a prefix,
                  its is looked up from the main schema e.g. ``other_field_name``.
                  Alternatively, pass the string “\*” to put a field first in the fieldsets form.
order\_after      The inverse of order\_before(), putting a field after another.
                  It works almost similar to ``order_before``,
                  except  passing “\*” will put the field at the end of the fieldsets form.
================= ======================================================================================================

*plone.supermodel.directives* provides these:

================= ======================================================================================================
Name              Description
================= ======================================================================================================
fieldset          Creates a new (or reuses an existing) fieldset (rendered in Plone as a tab on the edit form).
primary           Designate a given field as the primary field in the schema.
                  This is not used for form rendering, but is used for WebDAV marshaling of the content object.
================= ======================================================================================================

The code sample below illustrates each of these directives:

.. code-block:: python

    from plone.autoform import directives
    from plone.supermodel.directives import fieldset
    from plone.supermodel.directives import primary
    from plone.supermodel import model
    from plone.app.z3cform.wysiwyg import WysiwygFieldWidget
    from zope import schema


    class ISampleSchema(model.Schema):

        # A fieldset with id 'extra' and label 'Extra information' containing
        # the 'footer' and 'dummy' fields. The label can be omitted if the
        # fieldset has already been defined.

        fieldset('extra',
            label=u'Extra information',
            fields=['footer', 'dummy']
        )

        # Here a widget is specified as a dotted name.
        # The body field is also designated as the primary field for this schema

        directives.widget(body='plone.app.z3cform.wysiwyg.WysiwygFieldWidget')
        primary('body')
        body = schema.Text(
            title=u'Body text',
            required=False,
            default=u'Body text goes here'
        )

        # The widget can also be specified as an object

        directives.widget(footer=WysiwygFieldWidget)
        footer = schema.Text(
            title=u'Footer text',
            required=False
        )

        # An omitted field.
        # Use directives.omitted('a', 'b', 'c') to omit several fields

        directives.omitted('dummy')
        dummy = schema.Text(
            title=u'Dummy'
        )

        # A field in 'hidden' mode

        directives.mode(secret='hidden')
        secret = schema.TextLine(
            title=u'Secret',
            default=u'Secret stuff'
        )

        # This field is moved before the 'description' field of the standard
        # IDublinCore behavior, if this is in use.

        directives.order_before(importantNote='IDublinCore.description')
        importantNote = schema.TextLine(
            title=u'Important note',
        )

Security related directives
---------------------------

The security directives in the *plone.autoform.directives* module are shown below.
Note that these are also used to control reading and writing of fields on content instances.

==================== =================================================================================
Name                 Description
==================== =================================================================================
read\_permission     Set the name (zcml-style) of a permission required to read the field’s value.
                     Pass the field name as a key and the permission name as a string value.
                     Among other things, this controls the field’s appearance in display forms.
write\_permission    Set the name (zcml-style)  of a permission required to write the field’s value.
                     Pass the field name as a key and the permission name as a string value.
                     Among other things, this controls the field’s appearance in add and edit forms.
==================== =================================================================================

The code sample below illustrates each of these directives:

.. code-block:: python

    from plone.autoform import directives
    from plone.supermodel import model
    from zope import schema

    class ISampleSchema(model.Schema):

        # This field requires the 'cmf.ReviewPortalContent' permission
        # to be read and written

        directives.read_permission(reviewNotes='cmf.ReviewPortalContent')
        directives.write_permission(reviewNotes='cmf.ReviewPortalContent')
        reviewNotes = schema.Text(
            title=u'Review notes',
            required=False,
        )

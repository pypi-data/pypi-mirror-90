Williams and R. Kessler, Pair Programming Illuminated. Addison Wesley, 2003.\n\n<!-- One of the earliest occurrences of the term in a real project was in the Python\nmailing list: \n["If Guido was hit by a bus?"](https://legacy.python.org/search/hypermail/python-1994q2/1040.html) -->\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```\npip install truckfactor\n```\n\n### Requirements\n\nThe tool requires that `git` is installed and accessible on `PATH`.\n\n\n## How to use it?\n\nYou have to either point the tool to a directory containing a Git repository or\nto a URL with a remote repository. In case a URL is given, the tool will clone\nthe repository into a temporary directory.\n\nFrom the terminal, the tool can be run as in the following:\n\n```\nUsage:\n  truckfactor <repository> [<commit_sha>] [--output=<kind>]\n  truckfactor -h | --help\n  truckfactor --version\n\nOptions:\n  -h --help     Show this screen.\n  --version     Show version.\n  --output=<kind>  Kind of output, either csv or verbose.\n```\n\nFor example, in its most basic form it can be called like this:\n\n```bash\n$ truckfactor <path_or_url_to_repository>\nThe truck factor of <path_to_repository> (<commit_sha>) is: <number>\n```\n\nIf no `output` switch is given, the tool produces a single line output above. Otherwise, it will output a line in CSV format or in key: value form.\n\n\nCalling it from code:\n\n```python\nfrom truckfactor.compute import main\n\n\ntruckfactor, commit_sha = main("<path_to_repo>")\n```\n\n\n# How does the tool compute the truck factor?\n\nIn essence the tool does the following:\n\n  * Reads a git log from the repository\n  * Computes for each file who has the _knowledge ownership_ of it.\n    - A contributor has knowledge ownership of a file when she edited the most \n    lines in it.\n    - That computation is inspired by \n    [A. Thornhill _Your Code as a Crime Scene_](https://pragprog.com/titles/atcrime/your-code-as-a-crime-scene/).\n    - Note, only for text files knowledge ownership is computed. The tool may \n    not return a good answer for repositories containing only binary files.\n  * Then similar to [G. Avelino et al. *A novel approach for estimating Truck Factors*](https://peerj.com/preprints/1233.pdf) \n  low-contributing authors are removed from the analysis as long as still more \n  than half of all files have a knowledge owner. The amount of remaining \n  knowledge owners is the truck factor of the given repository.\n\n\n# Why does it exist?\n\nThis tool was developed since in Dec. 2020, we could not find an open-source and readily installable tool to compute truck factors of projects on PyPI or Rubygems.\n\n<!-- \n## References\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11219-019-09457-2\n\nA novel approach for estimating truck factors.\nhttps://github.com/aserg-ufmg/Truck-Factor\n\nAssessing the Bus Factor of Git Repositories (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081864&casa_token=fJYjmp-T3RUAAAAA:o_c0hD_yzQHTQJF0rGtEldCmxWlj_E0qn-NN67dxk4rps-p3fcBKpzzonY5SuFez8NEJ5sEx&tag=1)\nhttps://github.com/atlanmod/busfactor\nhttps://github.com/SOM-Research/busfactor\n   > the minimum number of people on your team who must be hit by a truck so that your project gets into serious trouble (Bowler, M.

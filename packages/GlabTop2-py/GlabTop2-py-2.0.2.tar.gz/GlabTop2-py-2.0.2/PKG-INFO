Description: GlabTop2-py
        ===========
        
        GlabTop2-py is a Python package that calculates the ice-thickness distribution for
        all glaciers in the model domain. GlabTop2-py uses Python 3.6 and PCRaster functionalities. GlabTop2-py is entirely based on the
        GlabTop2 concepts as described by `Frey et al., 2014 <https://www.the-cryosphere.net/8/2313/2014/tc-8-2313-2014.pdf>`_.

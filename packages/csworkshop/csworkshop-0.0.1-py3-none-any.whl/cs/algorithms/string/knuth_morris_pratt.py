def kmp_string_match(needle: str, haystack: str) -> Optional[int]:
    """
    The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm finds an occurrence of the specified needle string
    in the haystack string. To do this, we compute a failure table. Next, we iterate
    across the string, keeping track of a candidate start point and length matched so
    far. Whenever a match occurs, we update the length of the match we've made. On a
    failure, we update these values by trying to preserve the maximum proper border
    of the string we were able to manage by that point.

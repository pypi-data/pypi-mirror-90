    A Python implementation of the quick select algorithm (also called the kth order
    statistic), which is efficient for calculating the value that would appear in the
    index of a list if it would be sorted, even if it is not already sorted.

    Partition the data into smaller and greater lists in relation to the pivot, then
    recurse.

    Average runtime: O(n)
    Runtime: O(n^2)
    This algorithm is often much better than sorting, which is O(n log n).

    Given a connected, undirected graph with real-valued edge costs, returns an MST of
    that graph.

    The key difference between Dijkstra's algorithm and Prim's algorithm is that
    Dijkstra's algorithm creates a shortest-path tree from the source node, while Prim's
    algorithm builds an MST from the source node.

    First, we do O(|V|) insertions into the heap. We then do O(|V|) dequeues (since we
    only want a total of |V| - 1 edges). These dequeues take a total of O(|V| log |V)
    time, though any one dequeue might take much more than that. Finally, on each
    dequeue, we scan all outgoing edges from the dequeued node. Since we never consider
    a node twice, the total number of edges visited must be twice the number of edges in
    the graph, since each edge will be visited once from each endpoint, which is O(|E|)
    addiional time.

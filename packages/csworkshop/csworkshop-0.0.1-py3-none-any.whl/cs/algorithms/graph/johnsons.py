    """
    An implementation of Johnson's all-pairs shortest paths algorithm.  This algorithm
    is remarkable in that it combines two single-source shortest path algrithms -
    Dijkstra's algorithm and the Bellman-Ford algorithm - into a single algorithm for
    all-pairs shortest paths that ends up being more efficient than the Floyd-Warshall
    all-pairs shortest paths algorithm when run on sparse graphs.

    The idea behind Johnson's algorithm is to enforce that all the edge costs in the
    graph are nonnegative by computing a new potential function h(v) for each node in
    the graph, and then creating a new edge cost for each edge. With this new graph, we
    can use Dijkstra's to get the shortest paths.

    Bellman-Ford algorithm for the single-source shortest paths problem.

    The Bellman-Ford algorithm computes the shortest paths from a source node to all
    other nodes in the graph, like Dijkstra's algorithm, however with the added
    guarantee that the Bellman-Ford algorithm works correctly in graphs containing
    negative-cost edges, so long as the graph does not contain a negative cycle (in
    which case the cost of a shortest path may not be well-defined).

    If |E| = O(|V|^2), then running the Floyd-Warshall algorithm makes more sense, to
    get all shortest path pairs rather than just one. However, on sparse graphs where
    |E| = Theta(|V|)) the runtime is O(|V|^2), which is much faster.

    Runtime: O(|V||E|), or worst case, O(|V|^3).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrows%E2%80%93Wheeler_transform

The Burrows–Wheeler transform (BWT, also called block-sorting compression)
rearranges a character string into runs of similar characters. This is useful
for compression, since it tends to be easy to compress a string that has runs
of repeated characters by techniques such as move-to-front transform and
run-length encoding. More importantly, the transformation is reversible,
without needing to store any additional data except the position of the first
original character. The BWT is thus a "free" method of improving the efficiency
of text compression algorithms, costing only some extra computation.

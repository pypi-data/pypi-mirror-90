    Given a graph and a pair of nodes s and t, produces a maximum s-t flow in that
    graph. Any flow that already exists in the input network will be used as a guess of
    the maximum flow.

    The algorithm works by maintaining a candidate max flow, constructing the residual
    graph for that max flow, and then searching for an augmenting s-t path in the graph.
    If one is found, then the maximum possible flow is pushed along that path and the
    process repeats. Otherwise, no augmenting paths exist, and the flow must be maximum.

    Each time an augmenting path is found, the s-t flow increases by at least one, so
    the algorithm is guaranteed to terminate after at most F searches, where F is the
    value of the max-flow. Since each search to find an augmenting path from s to t
    takes O(m + n), the overall runtime is O((m + n)F).

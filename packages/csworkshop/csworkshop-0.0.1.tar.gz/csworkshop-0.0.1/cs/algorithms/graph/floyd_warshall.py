    Calculates the shortest distance between all vertex pairs using dynamic programming.
    distance[u][v] will contain the shortest distance from vertex u to v.

    1. For all edges from v to n, distance[i][j] = weight(edge(i, j)).
    3. The algorithm then performs distance[i][j] = min(distance[i][j], distance[i][k]
        + distance[k][j]) for each possible pair i, j of vertices.
    4. The above is repeated for each vertex k in the graph.
    5. Whenever distance[i][j] is given a new minimum value, next vertex[i][j] is
        updated to the next vertex[i][k].

    Unlike Dijkstra's Algorithm, the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm has no problems handling
    graphs with negative edge costs.

# clikan: CLI (Personal) Kanban
There has been a little chatter about 'personal' kanban on the tubes lately.  I don't know about the need to hype it as personal, but if you're looking to get your head wrapped around stuff needing to get done - then kanban is a healthy tool.  clikan is a super simple command-line utility for tracking tasks following the Japanese Kanban (boarding) style.  clikan's core intent is to be easy to use, and to maintain simplicity.

## Installation

$`pip install clikan`

### Create a `.clikan.yaml` in your $HOME directory

```yaml
---
clikan_data: /Users/kplummer/.clikan.dat
limits:
  todo: 10
  wip: 3
  done: 10
```

* `clikan_data` is the datastore file location.
* `limits:todo` is the max number of items allowed in the todo column, keep this small - you want a smart list, not an ice box of ideas here.
* `limits:wip` is the max number of items allowed in in-progress at a given time.  Context-switching is a farce, focus on one or two tasks at a time.
* `limits:done` is the max number of done items visible, they'll still be stored.  It's good to see a list of done items, for pure psyche.

-- or --

$`clikan configure`

to create a default data file location.

This is where the tool will store the history of files.  It's configurable so you can put the data in a Dropbox or other cloud-watched directory for safe archiving/backing up.

If you're like me, even `clikan` is a bunch too many characters to type, so shorten with an alias in my shell config to `clik`.

## Usage
The basic usage of clikan breaks down into three basic commands:

### Show

$`clikan show` (alias: s)

### Add

$`clikan add [task text]` (alias: a)

### Promote

$`clikan promote [task id]` (alias: p)

And there are more supporting commands:

### Regress

$`clikan regress [task id]`

### Delete

$`clikan delete [task id]`

### Configure

$`clikan configure`

## Development

It's Python code.  Fork, fix, and submit a PR - it'd be super appreciated.

Tests?  Um, yeah.

### Testing

Updated test suite to include 3.6-3.9 on Windows, macOS and Ubuntu.

***Definitely*** need some help here.  There is a basic test suite available in `clikan_test.py`.

To run it, make sure ~/.clikan.dat is empty, the you can run:

```
pytest clikan_test.py
```

If you don't want to whack your **working** version of clikan you do this:

```
CLIKAN_HOME=/tmp pytest clikan_test.py
```

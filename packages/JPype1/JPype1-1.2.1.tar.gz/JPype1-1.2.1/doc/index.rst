JPype documentation
===================

JPype is a Python module to provide full access to Java from within Python. It
allows Python to make use of Java specific libraries, explore and visualize
Java structures, develop and test Java libraries, make use of scientific
computing, and much more.  By enabling the use of Python for rapid prototyping
and Java for strong typed production code, JPype provides a powerful
environment for engineering and code development.

Unlike Jython, JPype does not achive this by re-implementing Python, but
instead by interfacing both virtual machines at the native level. This
shared memory based approach achieves good computing performance, while
providing the access to the entirety of CPython and Java libraries.

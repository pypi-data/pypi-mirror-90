# This is a short test to see what happens when we import using star.
#
#   Unfortunately this can only be done from a module level so we
#   will need to include a special module for this test.
#
#   When we start the test late2.jar will not be in the current classpath.
#   But we will add it later and make sure the directory updates for us.

``simpleor`` is a package that shows how Operations Research problems
can be solved with Python. This project primarily serves as a learning
experiment, although the package's functionality can be used in real-life.

Currently, ``simpleor`` supports:

- a scheduler, which assigns tasks to agents
- a matcher, which finds a maximum matching in fully connected graph

You can use this functionality directly, or use the package as a starting point to create
your own Operations Research solvers.

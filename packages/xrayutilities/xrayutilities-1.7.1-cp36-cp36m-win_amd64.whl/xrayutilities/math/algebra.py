"""
module providing analytic algebraic functions not implemented in scipy or any
other dependency of xrayutilities. In particular the analytic solution of a
quartic equation which is needed for the solution of the dynamic scattering
equations.
"""

def solve_quartic(a4, a3, a2, a1, a0):
    """
    analytic solution [1]_ of the general quartic equation. The solved equation
    takes the form :math:`a_4 z^4 + a_3 z^3 + a_2 z^2 + a_1 z + a_0`

    Returns
    -------
    tuple

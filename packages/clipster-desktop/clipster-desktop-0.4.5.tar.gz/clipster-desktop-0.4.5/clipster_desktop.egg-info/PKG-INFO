Description: # Clipster - Desktop Client
        
        [![GitHub Actions Build Workflow](https://github.com/mc51/Clipster-Desktop/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mc51/Clipster-Desktop/actions) [![PyPi version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/clipster-desktop.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/clipster-desktop)  
        
        Clipster is a multi platform cloud clipboard:  
        Copy a text on your smartphone and paste it on your desktop, or vice versa.  
        Easy, secure, open source.  
        Supports Android, Linux, MacOS, Windows and all browsers.   
        
        You can use the web front-end of the public server at [clipster.cc](https://clipster.cc).  
        For the Android client see [Clipster-Android](https://github.com/mc51/Clipster-Android).  
        To run your own server check [Clipster-Server](https://github.com/mc51/Clipster-Server).  
          
          
          
        ## Setup
        
        ### Linux 
        
        Install via pip:
        
        ``` bash
        pip install clipster-desktop
        ```
        
        Then, `clipster` will be available as a terminal command. To enable auto-start, execute the following setup script:
        
        ``` bash
        clipster_enable.sh
        ```
        
        This will add a Clipster service to [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd). (To disable auto-start, run `clipster_disable.sh`)  
          
        
        Alternatively, install the latest version from GitHub. Copy and paste the following in the console to clone the git repo and start the `install.sh` script:
        
        ``` bash
        git clone https://github.com/mc51/Clipster-Desktop.git && cd Clipster-Desktop && sh scripts/install.sh
        ```
        
        The install script takes care of everything.  
        
        ### Windows
        
        Download [`clipster.exe`](https://github.com/mc51/Clipster-Desktop/releases/latest/download/clipster.exe) from the latest Windows release and start it. To automatically start Clipster, open the current user's auto-start folder by opening Explorer and typing `shell:startup`. Copy `clipster.exe` there. 
        
        ### MacOS
        
        Download [`clipster.zip`](https://github.com/mc51/Clipster-Desktop/releases/latest/download/clipster.zip) from the latest MacOS release, move it to `Applications` and start it. You might get a warning message, that you need to ignore. Newer MacOS versions might even prevent you from opening it entirely at first. You have [two options](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac):  
        1. Open it in the Finder via `right click --> open`
        2. After failing to open it, go to `System Preferences --> Security & Privacy`. In the `General` Tab the App will be listed and you can start it from there  
          
        To automatically start Clipster, right click on the icon in your Dock and click on `Options --> Open at Login`.  
            
        Now, you can [use](#usage) clipster!  
          
        ## Usage
        
        On the first startup, you can either register a new account or enter your existing credentials for the login. Your credentials will be stored in your `HOMEPATH` in `./config/clipster/config`.  
        Clipster will add an Icon to your system tray which you can click for opening up a menu with the following options:  
        `Get last Clip` will fetch the last shared Clip from the server.  
        `Get all Clips` will fetch all shared Clips from the server.  
        `Share Clip` will share your current clipboard. Then, it's available for all your devices.  
        `Edit Credentials` allows you to register a new account or change your login credentials.  
        `Exit` will terminate the app.  
        
        ## Roadmap
        
        - [x] Encrypt / Decrypt clipboard locally and only transmit encrypted data to server
        - [x] Add clipboard history: share multiple Clips
        - [x] Add PyPi package
        - [ ] Support image sharing
        - [ ] iOS Client

Description: 
        routemaster-prometheus
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Usage, in your Routemaster configuration file:
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
           plugins:
             logging:
               - class: routemaster_prometheus.logger:PrometheusLogger
                 kwargs:
                   path: /metrics
        
        This package is based on the official Python Promeutheus bindings in
        `\ ``prometheus_client`` <https://pypi.org/project/prometheus_client/>`_. In order
        for that package to operate in a multithreaded program such as Routemaster,
        the environment variable ``prometheus_multiproc_dir`` must be set to a writeable
        directory for temporary files. It does not need to be backed up as nothing
        is persisted between application launches.
        
        This is already done for you in the ``thread/routemaster`` Docker image
        provided, but when deploying in a custom way you may wish to change this
        directory.

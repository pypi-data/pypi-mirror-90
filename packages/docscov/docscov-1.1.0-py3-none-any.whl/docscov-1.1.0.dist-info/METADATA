DocsCov
=======

DocsCov is a Sphinx extension that allows you to show a badge showing
documentation coverage for C++ (or any other Doxygen supported) code.


Getting Started
---------------

You need to use Doxygen to generate XML data about the source files. To do that,
add the following to your Doxygen configuration: (not needed if you're using
tools like Breathe or Exhale, you should have this already)

    GENERATE_XML = YES

This will generate XML data about source files. Now just add ``docscov`` to your
Sphinx extensions and add the following to your ``conf.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    docscov_config = {
        "xml_dir": "<path to generated XML by Doxygen>"
    }

It'll places a JSON file inside built documentations, which can be used with
`Shields <https://shields.io>`_ to make a dynamic badge, updated each time
documentations are built.


Getting the badge
+++++++++++++++++

To get the badge do the following:

1. Get the URL to your generated documentations (with ``http://`` or
   ``https://``)
2. Replace the ``:`` with ``%3A`` in the URL
3. Replace all slashes (``/``) in the text you got by completing step 2
4. Replace ``<url>`` in the following text with the text you got by completing
   step 3, and the text you'll get is the URL to your badge that can be placed in
   your README:

    https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=<url>%2F_static%2Fdocscov.json

Example: `<https://pypp.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_ will be converted to this
after following above:
`<https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpypp.readthedocs.io%2Fen%2Flatest%2F_static%2Fdocscov.json>`_

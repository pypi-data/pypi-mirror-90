Python code in this package is licensed under the GNU General Public
License v3 or later (GPLv3+).  In addition, the source repository
embeds different resources under different (free/libre and open)
license terms, following the REUSE best practices, see:
https://reuse.software/

As required for REUSE, the subdirectory LICENSES contains license
terms with their identifiers.  Those identifiers are included in
source files to clarify their license terms.  Some files may not
include license identifiers but come with an additional file whose
name ends in ".license"; that latter file either points to a license
or embeds usage terms.

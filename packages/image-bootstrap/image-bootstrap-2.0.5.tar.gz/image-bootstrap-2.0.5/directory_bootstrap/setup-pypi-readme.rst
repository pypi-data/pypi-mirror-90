``directory-bootstrap``
=======================

Command line tool for creating chroots.

Technically a meta-package to pull in
package `image-bootstrap <https://pypi.org/project/image-bootstrap/>`_,
that contains the actual ``directory-bootstrap`` code,
alongside its big brother ``image-bootstrap``
that creates bootable virtual machine images.

For more details on either of these please check out

Enjoy!

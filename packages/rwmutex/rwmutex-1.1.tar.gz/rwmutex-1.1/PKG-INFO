Description: # py-rwmutex
        
        This package provides a simple read/write mutex lock for threads, based upon
        the `threading` package. It supports Python's context manager interface, so
        it may be used within `with` statements.
        
        ## Purpose
        
        This read/write lock can improve performance by allowing multiple threads to
        reaad from a shared resource at once. For safety, only one thread is granted
        a write lock at a time, and only when no threads have a read lock.
        
        ## Installation
        
        This package is available from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/rwmutex/), which
        means it can be easily acquired via [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).
        
        Run this command at a shell prompt:
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install rwmutex
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        To get started, import the package like so:
        
        ```py
        from rwmutex import RWLock
        ```
        
        Then you can declare a lock object:
        
        ```py
        lock = RWLock()
        ```
        
        To use the lock, you can use `with` blocks:
        
        ```py
        with lock.write
            # some operation that writes
            pass
        
        with lock.read:
            # some operation that just needs to read
            pass
        ```
        
        For a working example, see [example.py](example.py).

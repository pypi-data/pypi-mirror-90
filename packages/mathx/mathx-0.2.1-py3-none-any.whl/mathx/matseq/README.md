# matseq
Matrix operations on sequences

# Overview
This package provides matrix/linear algebra operations on native Python sequences. The elements of the sequences must support arithmetic operations.

# Motivation
Sometimes I have pairs of lists of numpy arrays. I want to multiply and accumulate them elementwise (applying numpy broadcasting rules as I go).

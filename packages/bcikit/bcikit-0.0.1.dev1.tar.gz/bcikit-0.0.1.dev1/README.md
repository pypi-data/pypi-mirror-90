# Brain-Computer Interface Toolkit

The toolkit consists of datasets, model architectures, and common signal processing functions for BCI before applying on PyTorch.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/ntubci/bcikit.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Contributing

If you plan to contribute new dataset, features, utility functions, or extensions to the core, please first open an [issue](https://github.com/ntubci/bcikit/issues) and discuss the feature with us. Sending a PR without discussion might end up resulting in a rejected PR because we might be taking the core in a different direction than you might be aware of.

To learn more about making a contribution to Pytorch, please see our [Contribution](https://github.com/ntubci/bcikit/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) page.

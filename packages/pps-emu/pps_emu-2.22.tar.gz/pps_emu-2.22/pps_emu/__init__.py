# Name: Charles R. Whealton
# Project: Physical Programming Emulator (Bridge)
#
# Description:  This is the bridge code that students import into their Python programs
# in order to work with the Physical Programming Simulator.  This rewrite uses a dictionary
# to keep track of states, and there are startup states already embedded in it, so this
# can have the effort of providing erroneous information if the simulator has already been
# started before the program runs and sliders have already been changed or the light sensor
# has been switched from
#
# This is based on Jason Silverstein's work (v1.0)
#
# Version       Date        Initials        Description
# 2.00          08/28/20    CRW             Initial version, get UDP client server portion going, this
#                                           code will be imported into student's programs giving them
#                                           the input / output functions required to manipulate the LED
#                                           and buzzer devices (output) and receive data from the simulator
#                                           GUI representing the temperature, humidity, and pressure sliders,
#                                           as well as the four buttons, and light sensor toggle.  These
#                                           devices have their status stored in a state dictionary that
#                                           the input function reads from.  In the case of the buttons, it
#                                           first reads the value, then sets it to zero and returns 'pressed'
#                                           if the integer value is a 1, thus evaluating to a Boolean True.
#
# 2.01          08/31/20    CRW             Removed redundant debug statement from the read_values() while True
#                                           loop.  Added conditional to check if light sensor was being examined
#                                           and converted 0 / 1 to off / on.
# 2.02          09/01/20    CRW             Added reset reset message to cause GUI to reset all LEDS to off,
#                                           temperature sliders to default values of 0, 0, 29, and light sensor
#                                           back to default of night.  Added try/except for read_values().
# 2.022         09/12/20    CRW             Incremental numbering update for packaging stuff on pypi test.

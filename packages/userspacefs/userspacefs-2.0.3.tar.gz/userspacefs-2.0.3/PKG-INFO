Description: # userspacefs
        
        userspacefs is a library that allows you to easily write
        cross-platform user-space file systems in Python. macOS and Linux has
        been tested, but it has been designed to run on Windows and other
        POSIX platforms.
        
        It is primarily used to power [dbxfs](https://github.com/rianhunter/dbxfs).
        
        It is written for Python 3.5+ and is licensed under the GPLv3.

<!-- html --><p>If we combine with the counting number or natural numbers
a reversible process like adding and its counter process subtracting,
then we have introduced the <strong>integers</strong>.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mathbb{Z} = \mathbb{N}\times\{+,-\}\]</div>
<p>Repeat the adding and we have a new operation: the multiplication.</p>
<p>Now let’s combine this new operation with the integers.
The counter process is division.
Now we have introduced the <strong>rational numbers</strong>.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\mathbb{Q} = \mathbb{Z}\times\{+,-\}\\
\mathbb{Q} = \mathbb{N}\times\{+,-\}\times\{\cdot,\div\}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Repeat the multiplication and we have the new operation “to the power”.</p>
<p>Now not any more that analogously, but basically yes,
rationals combined with power operation extend to a new set of numbers
the <strong>algebraic numbers</strong>.</p>
<p>Numbers so far contain processes, so the make up an <strong>algorithm</strong>.  If we allow
infinite algorithms, we extend further by including the <strong>irrational numbers</strong>
(algebraic and transcendental) and thus extend to the <strong>real numbers</strong>.</p>

<p>Finite and infinte algorithms: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> is infinite if expressed with the
basic operations.  But if we do not evaluate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> but use it
symbolically only then this is a finite algorithm.</p>

If we combine with the counting number or natural numbers
a reversible process like adding and its counter process subtracting,
then we have introduced the **integers**.

.. math::

    \mathbb{Z} = \mathbb{N}\times\{+,-\}

Repeat the adding and we have a new operation: the multiplication.

Now let's combine this new operation with the integers.
The counter process is division.
Now we have introduced the **rational numbers**.

.. math::

    \mathbb{Q} = \mathbb{Z}\times\{+,-\}\\
    \mathbb{Q} = \mathbb{N}\times\{+,-\}\times\{\cdot,\div\}


Repeat the multiplication and we have the new operation "to the power".

Now not any more that analogously, but basically yes,
rationals combined with power operation extend to a new set of numbers
the **algebraic numbers**.

Numbers so far contain processes, so the make up an **algorithm**.  If we allow
infinite algorithms, we extend further by including the **irrational numbers**
(algebraic and transcendental) and thus extend to the **real numbers**.

.. admonition:: Note

    Finite and infinte algorithms: `\sqrt{2}` is infinite if expressed with the
    basic operations.  But if we do not evaluate `\sqrt{2}` but use it
    symbolically only then this is a finite algorithm.

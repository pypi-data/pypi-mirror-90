The radiocarbon dating method (C14-Method, C14 is a radioactive carbon isotope) uses
the fact that the C14 concentration in living organisms stays constant
and it diminishes exponentially once dead.
The half-life of C14 is \(t_H\)={{5730}} years (\(0.5=e^{-\lambda t_H}\)).
Determine how old a fossil bone is that still contains {{chiven.pc}}% C14.
t = years

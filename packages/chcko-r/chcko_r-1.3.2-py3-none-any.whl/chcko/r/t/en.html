The overall costs of a business are modeled with a quadratic function<br>
\[K(x)=ax^2+bx+c\]
The overheads (fixed costs) are known to be €{{chiven.cf}}.
With {{chiven.A[0][1]}} units the costs are €{{chiven.b[0]+chiven.cf}}
and with {{chiven.A[1][1]}} units they are €{{chiven.b[1]+chiven.cf}}.
Determine the coefficients a, b, c of the cost function and enter
them rounded to integers

<!-- html --><p>If we see the ingredients of a set of cake recipes as vector space,
then every cake <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span> is a vector of the <em>ingredient vector space</em>.
We independently choose an amount from each ingredient (variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z_i\)</span>).
We use the value 0, if the ingredient is not used at all.</p>
<p>If we only look at the cakes,
then a choice from them is a vector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> in the <em>cake vector space</em>.
Every <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k_j\)</span> is the number of cakes of kind <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span>.</p>
<p>When going from the cakes to the ingredients,
one does a coordinate transformation.
To get the total amount of ingredient <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z_i\)</span>
one needs to multiply the number of each cake <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k_j\)</span>
with the amount of ingredient <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> for that cake.
This is a matrix multiplication.</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z = ZK \cdot k = \sum_j ZK_{ij}k_j\)</span></p>
<p>In <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ZK\)</span> every column is a recipe,
i.e. the ingredients (<strong>components</strong>) for cake <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span>.</p>
<p>To obtain the price <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> in the <em>price vector space</em>,
i.e. what is the cost of all ingredients for a set of cakes,
we multiply again</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p = PZ \cdot z = PZ_{1i} z_i\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(PZ\)</span> is a matrix with one row.
The number of rows is the dimension of the target vector space.</p>

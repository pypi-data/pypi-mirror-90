a) How does the charge Q depend on time t?
\(Q(t)=\)
%chq(0)
<br>
The resistor, over which the capacity discharges, is R={{chiven.r}}\(k\Omega\).
At time t=0s we measure a voltage at the capacitor of {{chiven.u}}V,
and at t={{chiven.t}}s the voltage is {{round(chiven.u2,2)}}V.
<br>
b) Find the capacity of the capacitor? \(\frac{C}{Î¼F}=\)
%chq(1)
<br>
c) What is the charge at t=0s? \(\frac{Q_o}{As}=\)
%chq(2)
<br>
d) What is the charge at t={{chiven.t}}s? \(\frac{Q_t}{As}=\)
%chq(3)
<br>
e) After how many second is the fully loaded capacitor only half loaded?
%chq(4)

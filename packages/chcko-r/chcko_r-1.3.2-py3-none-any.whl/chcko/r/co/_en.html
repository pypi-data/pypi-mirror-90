<!-- html --><p>In mathematics as in daily life <strong>concrete</strong> observations
that repeat, are described once and then referred to later.
The common pattern in many observations is called <strong>abstrakt</strong>.
They make descriptions shorter in their totality.</p>
<p>For learners it is often difficult to link the abstract with the concrete
again. Therefore it is good to comment definitions and theorems with motivation,
examples and applications.</p>
<p>First one normally starts with the concrete, recognizes common patterns by comparing,
which is called <strong>analysis</strong>, and the result is the <strong>abstraction</strong>.
This is <strong>reduction of redundancy</strong> and <strong>compression</strong>, a fundamental cognitive process.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Mathematics often uses the <strong>equivalence relation</strong>
(= <strong>reflexive, symmetrische und transitive Relation</strong>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sim\)</span>)
as a tool to describe abstraction.
One focuses on one or a few properties and leaves others out.
All elements with a certain value of the property variable
are equivalent and form an equivalence class.
All equivalence classes make up the <strong>quotient space</strong>
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M/\sim\)</span>, which is a set of disjoint subsets of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Abstract concepts can be combined again (<strong>Synthesis</strong>).
This is the principle of <strong>creativity</strong>.</p>

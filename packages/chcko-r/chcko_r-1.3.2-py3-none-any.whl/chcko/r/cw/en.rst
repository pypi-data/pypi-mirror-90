Complexity

    To refer to a value of a variable one needs memory space.
    If the value (reference) can be calculated from (the values of) other variables,
    then one can do without that memory.
    This is why functions are important.

    On the other hand one has to do calculations, now,
    to reference to the value of the variable. This need time.

    **Complexity** is a meassure for the needed resources.
    If a lot of time is needed, then the time complexity is high.
    If a lot of memory is needed, the the space complexit is high.

    Since computing power varies widely one only mentions the order of
    magnitude in dependence of the cardinality of the data set to process via
    the O-notation , e.g. `O(n^2)`.

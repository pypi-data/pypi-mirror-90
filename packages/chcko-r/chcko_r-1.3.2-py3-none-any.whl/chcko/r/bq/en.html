For a skateboard park a halfpipe shall be constructed.
The cross section is delimited by two parabolas.
The inner parabola is {{chiven.w}}cm broad and {{chiven.h}}cm deep
and the outer parabola is
{{chiven.w+2*chiven.dw}}cm broad and {{chiven.h+chiven.dh}}cm deep.
The length of the halfpipe is {{chiven.d}}cm.

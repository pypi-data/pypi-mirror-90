For a party the above table shows the missing ingredients for the planned types of cakes
Here are numbers planned for each type:
<table>
%for i,n in enumerate(kinds):
    <tr>
    <td>{{n}}</td>
    <td>{{ chiven.CC[i] }}</td>
    </tr>
    %end
</table>
Interpret the numbers as vectors in the vector space of cakes.
Transform to the vector space of ingredients by doing a matrix multiplication.
<br>
How many eggs must be bought?
%chq(0)
<br>
Afterwards transform to the vector space of cost by another Matrix multiplication
with the following unit prices (price matrix).
<table>
<tr>
%for u in units:
    <td>{{u}}</td>
    %end
</tr>
<tr>
%for m in chiven.PP:
    <td>{{m}}</td>
    %end
</tr>
</table>

How much money is needed to do the shopping? 
%chq(1)

The production costs K of a product are linear.
For {{chiven.A[0][1]}} units the costs are €{{chiven.b[0]}} and
for {{chiven.A[1][1]}} units they are  €{{chiven.b[1]}}.
Calculate the variable unit costs \(\bar{K_v}\) and the overheads (fixed costs) \(K_f\).

%chq(chames=[r'\(K_f\) = €',r'\(\bar{K_v}\) = €'])

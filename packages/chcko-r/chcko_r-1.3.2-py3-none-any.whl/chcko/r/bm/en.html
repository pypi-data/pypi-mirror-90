If there is a linear price-sales function \(p(x)=kx+d\), how does
the expression for the marginal revenue \(E'(x)\) look like? (use \(E(x)=xp(x)\)).
</li><li>
Through market observations an upper price limit (intersection
between \(p(x)\) and p axis) is fixed at €{{ chiven.pmax }}.
The saturation quantity (intersection between \(p(x)\) and the x axis)
is estimated with {{ 2*chiven.xp0 }}.
What is the model for the marginal revenue?
<br>\(E'(x)=\)
%chq(0, chow = chutil.tx)
</li><li>
Through integration of this marginal revenue one gets the total revenue.
<br>\(E(x) =\)
%chq(1, chow = chutil.tx)
<br>
How to determine the integration constant?
</li><li>
Costs consist of fixed costs and variable costs.
Are the fixed costs independent from the production quantity and why?
</li><li>
The marginal costs are assumed to be quadratic
\(K'(x)= {{ chutil.TX(chiven.Kp) }} \).
Which model describes the total costs (integration)?
To get the integration constant consider that even with no production
there is €{{ chiven.Ko }} cost.
<br>\(K(x)=\)
%chq(2, chow = chutil.tx)
</li><li>
Write down the expression for the cost function c(x).
<br>\(c(x) =\)
%chq(3, chow = chutil.tx)
</li><li>
Write down the price elasticity \(\epsilon(x)\)
(use the Amoroso-Robinson-Relation or the definition of \(\epsilon\))
<br>\(\epsilon(x) =\)
%chq(4, chow = chutil.tx)
</li><li>
With what production quantity do we have maximum profit?
<br>\(x_g =\)
%chq(5)
</li><li>
Is the demand at this production quantity elastic and why?
</li><li>
What price does one have to use to maximize the profit?
<br>\(p(x_g) =\)
%chq(6)
</li><li>
What is the name of this point \( (x_g,p(x_g)) \)?

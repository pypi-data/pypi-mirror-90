â‚¬{{chiven.K0}} is deposited on {{chiven.d1.strftime('%d.%m.%Y')}}
and withdrawn {{chiven.d2.strftime('%d.%m.%Y')}} with amounted interests.
The bank calculates full calendar years (1.1. - 30.12, 12x30M, 360T)
with compound interest and not full years linearly (combined or practical interests).
The annual interest rate is {{chiven.i}}%.<br>
Calculate the capital at the time of withdrawal.

If the bank did use compound interest during the whole period (incomplete years
are fractions) (theoretical interest), what would the difference of this
capital from the previously calculated one?

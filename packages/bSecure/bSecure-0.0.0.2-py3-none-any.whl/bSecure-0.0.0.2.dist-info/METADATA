# bSecure

    "currency_code": "PKR",
    "order_id": "order-id-in-your-system-0001",
    "customer": {
        "name": "your customer name",
        "email": "your.customer.email@yourapplication.com",
        "country_code": "92",
        "phone_number": "345-6789012"
    },
    "products": {
        "0": {
            "id": "product-id-in-your-system-0001",,
            "name": "BAZIC Asst. Size Paint Brush Set (15/Pack)",
            "sku": "product-sku-in-your-system-123",

            "short_description": "Detailed description for product. Here you will share all that you know about the product."

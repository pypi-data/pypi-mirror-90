# gconf

Managing a config globally throughout a Python application

## Overview

With gconf, yaml configuration files can be loaded on module-scope
such that its values can be accessed from anywhere in a running application.

## Usage

### Loading yaml files

One or more yaml configuration files are loaded globally from path-like objects,
usually in a program's main function.
The resulting configuration is an overlay of all loaded configurations
with those that were loaded later taking precedence.

Loading a single config file:
```python
gconf.load('conf.yml')
```

Loading multiple config files at once:
```python
gconf.load('conf1.yml', 'conf2.yml')
```

Loading multiple config files one after the other:
```python
gconf.load('conf1.yml')
gconf.load('conf2.yml')
```

The two examples above produce an identical result.
In both cases `config2` takes precedence over `config1` and overrides its values.

Each invocation of `load` returns a list of all paths that have actually been loaded.

Loading the first config from a list of paths:
```python
gconf.load_first('conf1.yml', 'conf2.yml')
```

If `conf1.yml` exists, it is loaded and `conf2.yml` is ignored.
if `conf1.yml` does not exist, `conf2.yml` is loaded.

`load_first` returns the path that has actually been loaded.

All loading functions raise a `FileNotFoundError` if no file is found.
This can be prevented by setting the keyword-argument `required=False`.


### Manually adding values

A dict can be added to the config from within the application.
This is equivalent to loading a config file with the same content
and overrides values if they are already present or adds them if not.

```python
gconf.add({'parent': {'child': 'new child'}})
```

Warning: using this functionality, it is possible to the gconf module as a store for global variables.
Global variables are a code smell and should not be used!
Please use the `gconf.add()` function only if you know exactly what you are doing.


### Accessing config values

There are several ways of addressing the values that are stored in the config,
all of them using the module-level `get` method.

Dot-notation
```python
gconf.get('parent.child.some value')
```

String arguments
```python
gconf.get('parent', 'child', 'some value')
```

A mix of both
```python
gconf.get('parent.child', 'some value')
```

Top-level item as dictionary
```python
gconf.get()['parent']['child']['some value']
```

Some intermediate item as dictionary
```python
gconf.get('parent')['child']['some value']
```

To access list items, simply use their index in the path
```python
gconf.get('list.3')
```

#### Default value

The `get` method accepts a `default` argument, which is returned
if the specified item does not exist:
```python
gconf.get('non-existing', default=default_value)
```
This even works for falsey values like `False`, `None` or the empty string.

### Environment Variables Override

Config values are overridden by environment variables. As keys of environment variables are uppercase with
 underscores by convention, gconf expects them in that way. The conversion rules are:
1. `GCONF_` prefix is added to avoid conflicts
1. hierarchy levels are separated by underscore
2. spaces are replaced by underscore
3. all text is in all-caps

Examples:

| gconf.get         | environment var         |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| parent.some child | GCONF_PARENT_SOME_CHILD |
| list.0.entry      | GCONF_LIST_0_ENTRY      |

### Errors

If an attempt is made at loading non-existing files and `required=True` (the default), an `FileNotFoundError` is raised.

If no `default` is provided, an attempt to access a non-existing item raises a `KeyError`.

### Temporary override

Parts of the config can be temporarily overridden through a context manager.
Pass it a dictionary that overlays the existing one:
```python
with gconf.override_conf({'parent': {'child': 'override_value'}}):
    gconf.get('parent.child')  # => 'override_value'
gconf.get('parent.child')  # => 'original_value'
```

To temporarily remove parts of the config the `DELETED` constant can be used:
```python
with gconf.override_conf({'parent': {'child': gconf.DELETED}}):
    gconf.get('parent.child')  # => KeyError
gconf.get('parent.child')  # => 'original_value'
```

### Resetting

The global gconf dict can be completely reset.

```python
gconf.reset()
```

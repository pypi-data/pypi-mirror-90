Web-PDB is a web-interface for Python's built-in `PDB`_ debugger.
It allows to debug Python scripts remotely in a web-browser.

Features
========

- Responsive design based on `Bootstrap`_.
- Python syntax highlighting with `Prism`_ ("Okaida" theme).
- Supports all PDB features.
- Standard input and output can be redirected to the web-console
  to interact with Python scripts remotely.
- **Current file** box tracks current position in a file being executed.
  Red line numbers indicate breakpoints, if any.
- **Globals** and **Locals** boxes show local and global variables in the current scope.
  Special variables that start and end with double underscores ``__`` are excluded
  (you can always view them using PDB commands).
- Human-readable Unicode literals for Python 2.
- Command history that stores up to 10 last unique PDB commands (accessed by arrow UP/DOWN keys).

Usage
=====

Install Web-PDB into your working Python environment::

  pip install web-pdb

Insert the following line into your Python program at the point where you want
to start debugging:

.. code-block:: python

  import web_pdb; web_pdb.set_trace()

The ``set_trace()`` call will suspend your program and open a web-UI at the default port ``5555``
(port value can be changed). Enter in your browser's address bar:
``http://<your Python machine hostname or IP>:5555``,
for example ``http://monty-python:5555``,
and you should see the web-UI like the one on the preceding screenshot.
Now you can use all PDB commands and features. Additional **Current file**, **Globals**
and **Locals** information boxes help you better track your program runtime state.

**Note**: it is strongly recommended to work with the Web-PDB web-UI only in one browser session.
With more than one browser window accessing the web-UI it may display incorrect data in one or more
browser sessions.

Subsequent ``set_trace()`` calls can be used as hardcoded breakpoints.

Web-PDB is compatible with the new `breakpoint()`_ function added in Python 3.7.
Set environment variable ``PYTHONBREAKPOINT="web_pdb.set_trace"`` to launch Web-PDB
with ``breakpoint()``.

Additionally, Web-PDB provides ``catch_post_mortem`` context manager that can catch
unhandled exceptions raised within its scope and automatically start PDB post-mortem debugging session.
For example:

.. code-block:: python

  import web_pdb

  with web_pdb.catch_post_mortem():
      # Some error-prone code
      assert foo == bar, 'Oops!'

For more detailed info about the Web-PDB API read docstrings in the ``./web_pdb/__init__.py`` file.

The ``inspect`` Command
-----------------------

Web-PDB provides ``inspect`` or ``i`` command that is not present in the original PDB.
This command outputs the list of object's members along with their values.
Syntax: ``inspect <object_name>`` or ``i <object_name>``.

Special members with names enclosed in double underscores (``__``) are ignored.

Considerations for Multithreading and Multiprocessing Programs
==============================================================
Multithreading
--------------

Web-PDB maintains one debugger instance that traces only one thread. You should not call ``set_trace()``
from different threads to avoid race conditions. Each thread needs to be debugged separately one at a time.

Multiprocessing
---------------

Each process can have its own debugger instance provided you call ``set_trace`` with a different port value
for each process. This way you can debug each process in a separate browser tab/window.
To simplify this you can use ``set_trace(port=-1)`` to select a random port between 32768 and 65536.

Compatibility
=============

- **Python**: 2.7, 3+
- **Browsers**: Firefox, Chrome (all modern browsers should work)

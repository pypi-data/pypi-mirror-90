Description: # Wagtail Shell
        
        Wagtail Shell is an experimental frontend for Wagtail admin that converts it into a single-page-application and improvements to the left hand menu.
        
        Features:
         
         - No page reloads for general navigation!
         - Left hand menu rewritten in React, with improved animations and a new collapsed mode
         - Support for views written for different frontend frameworks, such as Django admin
         - A new modal workflow UI that supports rendering any view in a modal
        
        Coming soon:
        
         - Ability to write new API-driven views entirely in JavaScript (using React, Vue, or something else)

        # Installation
        
        **Please note that this project is still very much experimental, is not very well tested, and is likely to change in backwards-incompatible ways without notice**
        
        But if you'd like help this project by being an early tester, here's how to install!
        
        Install ``wagtail-shell`` with pip:
        
            pip install wagtail-shell
        
        
        Add it to ``INSTALLED_APPS``:
        
        ```python
        # settings.py
        
        INSTALLED_APPS = [
            # ...
        
            # Must be above wagtail.admin
            'wagtail_shell',
        
            # ...
        ]
        
        ```
        
        Decorate all Wagtail admin URLs with ``shell_enable`` using Wagtail's ``decorate_urlpatterns`` helper:
        
        ```python
        # urls.py
        
        from django.conf.urls import include, url
        from wagtail.admin import urls as wagtailadmin_urls
        from wagtail.utils.urlpatterns import decorate_urlpatterns
        from wagtail_shell.decorators import shell_enable
        
        
        urlpatterns = decorate_urlpatterns([
            # All URLs that you want to use the Wagtail menu on go here
            # You can also add Django admin or custom views here if you want to!
            url(r'^admin/', include(wagtailadmin_urls)),
        ], shell_enable) + [
            # All other URLs here
        ]
        ```

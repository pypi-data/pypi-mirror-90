Python module that facilitates asking common types of questions to the user.
Accounts for invalid user responses and reprompts the question. Provides a high
amount of customization for handling edge cases and input sanitization with
straightforward default parameters.

def yes_no_cast(response: str):
    '''
    Function to determine whether a given string represents the affirmative or
    the negative.

    Valid affirmative responses incude: 'yes' 'YES' 'y' 'Y' 'yup'

    Valid negative responses include: 'no' 'N' 'nein' 'foo'

    Arguments

        response    str containing an affirmative, negative, or something else

    Returns

        True if the response is the affirmative, otherwise False
    '''

    # or negative for that matter. The stakes aren't high, this works.

    '''
    Generalized function for asking the user questions, validating their
    response, and responding accordingly.

    Arguments

        prompt      The question to ask the user

        in_bounds   A function verifying that the user's response is within the
                    domain of correct answers. For example, if the question asks
                    for an answer between 1 and 100, in_bounds makes sure that
                    1 < response < 100

        cast        The cast that should be applied to the string returned by
                    input() to correctly format the user's input

        error       The message to print when the user inputs an invalid
                    response

    Returns

        A valid response from the user

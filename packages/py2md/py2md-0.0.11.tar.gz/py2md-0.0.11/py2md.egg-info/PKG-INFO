Description: # py2md
        
        Run python code in Jupyter to generate markdown reports.
        
        **Usage:**
        
        ```
        py2md test_py2md.py
        ```
        
        This will then run Jupyter and generate a md file output with associated images.
        
        **Debug Usage:**
        
        ```
        py2md test_py2md.py -debug
        ```
        
        This will also print out all Jupyter output to see if anything is missing from the output.
        
        **No Code, No Cell Headers and inline images Usage:**
        
        ```
        py2md test_py2md.py -nocode -nohead -inline
        ```
        
        This will hide the python code block as well as cell headers and all images will be part of the markdown file as html code.

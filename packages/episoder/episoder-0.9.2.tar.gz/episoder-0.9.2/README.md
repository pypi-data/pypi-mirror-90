Episoder is a tool to tell you about new episodes of your favourite TV shows. It
does so by parsing online TV episode guides.

Currently episoder can get data from [epguides](http://www.epguides.com/) and
[TheTVDB](http://www.epguides.com/) and tells you whenever a new episode of a
show listed on one of those sites is aired.

There is also a web-based version of episoder, called
[webisoder](https://github.com/cockroach/webisoder) which can be used for free
at [webisoder.net](https://www.webisoder.net/).

In order to use episoder, you will need python installed on your system. In
addition to the default distribution, the `requests`, `sqlalchemy` and `bs4`
modules are required.

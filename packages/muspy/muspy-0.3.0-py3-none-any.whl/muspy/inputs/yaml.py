    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str, Path or TextIO
        Path to the file or the file to load.
    compressed : bool, optional
        Whether the file is a compressed YAML file (`.yaml.gz`). Has no
        effect when `path` is a file object. Defaults to infer from the

    Notes
    -----
    When a path is given, assume UTF-8 encoding and gzip compression if
    `compressed=True`.

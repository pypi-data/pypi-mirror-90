The Nintendo Entertainment System Music Database (NES-MDB) is a dataset \
intended for building automatic music composition systems for the NES audio \
synthesizer. The NES synthesizer has highly constrained compositional \
parameters which are well-suited to a wide variety of current machine \
learning techniques. The synthesizer is typically programmed in assembly, but \
we parse the assembly into straightforward formats that are more suitable for \
machine learning."""

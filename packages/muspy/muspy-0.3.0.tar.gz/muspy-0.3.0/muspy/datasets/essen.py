This is a collection of about 8000 European and Chinese folk songs written in \
Essen Associative Code (EsAC). This database was started under the direction \
of the late Helmut Scaffrath who invented the EsAC code. Seymour Shlien \
converted the database into abc music notation using a tcl/tk script that \
Seymour Shlien wrote. Damien Sagrillo and Ewa Dahlig-Turek made available \
several other collections (HAYDN.SM, IRL.SM, LUX.SM, LOT.SM, HAN1.SM and \
HAN2.SM which were not publicly available.)"""

    """Encode a Music object into pitch-based representation.

    The pitch-based represetantion represents music as a sequence of
    pitch, rest and (optional) hold tokens. Only monophonic melodies are
    compatible with this representation. The output shape is T x 1,
    where T is the number of time steps. The values indicate whether the
    current time step is a pitch (0-127), a rest (128) or (optionally) a
    hold (129).

    Parameters
    ----------
    music : :class:`muspy.Music`
        Music object to encode.
    use_hold_state : bool
        Whether to use a special state for holds. Defaults to False.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray, dtype=uint8, shape=(?, 1)
        Encoded array in pitch-based representation.

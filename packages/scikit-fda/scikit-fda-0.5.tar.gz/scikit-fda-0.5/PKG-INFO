Description: Functional Data Analysis, or FDA, is the field of Statistics that analyses
        data that depend on a continuous parameter.
        
        This package offers classes, methods and functions to give support to FDA
        in Python. Includes a wide range of utils to work with functional data, and its
        representation, exploratory analysis, or preprocessing, among other tasks
        such as inference, classification, regression or clustering of functional data.

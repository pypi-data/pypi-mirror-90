            shell> pip install mx-notes
        ```

            shell> git clone https://github.com/amunger3/mx-notes.git

            shell> python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### CLI
        
        MX-Notes can be ran from the command line with the command `mx`:
        
        ```shell
            shell> mx <notes-dir> --host <host> --port <port>
        ```
        
        where `notes-dir` represents the path to your desired MX-Notes directory.
        
        #### Defaults
        
        - `notes-dir`: `~/MX-Notes` (will create directory if it doesn't exist)
        - `host`: `127.0.0.1` (localhost)
        - `port`: `5000`
        
        ## Features
        
        ### Creating Notes
        
        Notes are created by selecting the 'New' button. Setting the title is optional.
        Notes are saved automatically as they are edited.
        
        ### Editing Notes
        
        The note editing screen allows the user to edit the note title and content. Math
        symbols and their keybindings are shown on the left panel for quick access.
        
        ### Listing Notes
        
        When the app is started, the main screen is a list of notes in the specified directory.
        These notes are ordered by modification time. Clicking on a note's title will bring up its edit screen.
        
        ### Notes Format
        
        Notes are saved as <note-title>.txt with a Markdown-style title followed by the note's content.

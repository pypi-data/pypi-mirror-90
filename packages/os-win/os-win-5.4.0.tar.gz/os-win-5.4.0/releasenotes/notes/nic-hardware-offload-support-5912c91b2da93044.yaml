    Hyper-V can take advantage of different NIC hardware offload capabilities
    and can assign different offloading resources to VM NICs (SR-IOV, IOV
    queues, VMQs, IPSec).
    hostutils can now retrieve all the different NIC hardware offloading
    resources available to Hyper-V (depending on the physical NICs assigned).
    networkutils can now enable / assign different NIC hardware offloading
    resources to a given vSwitch port.

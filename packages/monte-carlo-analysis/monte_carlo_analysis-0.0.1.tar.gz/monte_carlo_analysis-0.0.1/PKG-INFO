Description: # Monte Carlo Analysis
        
        This python package analyses the output of a monte-carlo dropout network. The method to analyse the different uncertainty maps are described in the following article:

        A talk a given at [UNSURE](https://unsuremiccai.github.io/) a workshop of [MICCAI conference](https://www.miccai2020.org/en/) is available at this link on Youtube:

        # Usage
        
        A documentation of the code can be found on the website [ReadTheDoc](https://monte-carlo-analysis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and a tutorial can be found on [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Sw5mnIiho8YdEkVykrRTH12KjD51OuNp?usp=sharing). In the process of re-writting the article the name of the classes might not match the code anymore but this will be changed as soon as possible.
        
        Even if the presented application in the talk and the article is made on 3D MR images of carotid artery, the code can be applied to any kind of n-d imaging data as long as they are converted to numpy arrays.
        
        # Requirements
        
        Python 3.8
        
        # Installation
        
        Install via pip
        ``` bash
        $ python3 -m pip install monte_carlo_analysis
        ```
        
        # Todo
        
        - Adapt the code to numba to decrease the execution time

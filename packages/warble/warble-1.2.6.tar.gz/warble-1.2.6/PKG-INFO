Description: PyWarble
        ########
        PyWarble provides Python classes that wrap around the exported functions of the `Warble <https://github.com/mbientlab/Warble>`_ 
        C library.  
        
        Install
        #######
        Use ``pip`` to install the warble package.  
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install warble
            
        As this project requires compiling the ``warble`` C library, you will need to configure your target machine to have the 
        appropriate build environment before running ``pip`` as described in warble's 
        `README <https://github.com/mbientlab/Warble/blob/master/README.md#build>`_.

Description: # aiomysensors
        
        Python asyncio package to connect to MySensors gateways.
        
        ## MySensors version support
        
        The following versions are supported:
        
        - 1.4
        - 1.5
        
        ## Example
        
        ```py
        """Show a minimal example using aiomysensors."""
        import asyncio
        
        from aiomysensors import AIOMySensorsError, Gateway, SerialTransport
        
        
        async def run_gateway() -> None:
            """Run a serial gateway."""
            port = "/dev/ttyACM0"
            baud = 115200
            transport = SerialTransport(port, baud)
            gateway = Gateway(transport)
        
            try:
                async with gateway.transport:
                    async for message in gateway.listen():
                        print("Message received:", message)
            except AIOMySensorsError as err:
                print("Error:", err)
        
        
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            try:
                asyncio.run(run_gateway())
            except KeyboardInterrupt:
                pass
        ```
        
        ## Command Line Interface
        
        There's a CLI for testing purposes.
        
        ```sh
        aiomysensors --debug serial-gateway -p /dev/ttyACM0
        ```
        
        ## Development
        
        - Install and set up development environment.
        
          ```sh
          pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
          ```
        
          This will install all requirements.
        It will also install this package in development mode, so that code changes are applied immediately without reinstall necessary.
        
        - Here's a list of development tools we use.
          - [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/)
          - [flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/)
          - [mypy](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/)
          - [pydocstyle](https://pypi.org/project/pydocstyle/)
          - [pylint](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/)
          - [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/)
          - [tox](https://pypi.org/project/tox/)
        - It's recommended to use the corresponding code formatter and linters also in your code editor to get instant feedback. A popular editor that can do this is [`vscode`](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
        - Run all tests, check formatting and linting.
        
          ```sh
          tox
          ```
        
        - Run a single tox environment.
        
          ```sh
          tox -e lint
          ```
        
        - Reinstall all tox environments.
        
          ```sh
          tox -r
          ```
        
        - Run pytest and all tests.
        
          ```sh
          pytest
          ```
        
        - Run pytest and calculate coverage for the package.
        
          ```sh
          pytest --cov-report term-missing --cov=aiomysensors
          ```

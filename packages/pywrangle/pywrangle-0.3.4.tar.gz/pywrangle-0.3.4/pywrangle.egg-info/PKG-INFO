Description: # Pywrangle
        
        ## About
        PyWrangle is an open-source Python library for data wrangling. Wikipedia defines [data wrangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling) as follows:
        > is the process of transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics
        
        ## Functions
        PyWrangle currently supports:
        - cleaning strings
        - tracking dataframe changes
        - identifying data entry errors

        # History
        
        ## Version = "0.3.03
        - Removed walrus operator for Pre-3.8 compatability. Now Python 3.6+ compatable.
        
        ## Version = "0.3.0"
        - Removed identify missing data from library -- too much overlap with the missingno library.
        - Added identify_errors() function. Uses levenshtein's distance & double metaphone string matching algorithms to identify potential data entry errors in string columns.
        - Refactored code into different sub libraries
        - Placed documentation on ReadTheDocs.
        
        ## version = "0.2.40"
        - refactored code for clarity
        - added display info to print_df_changes
        
        ## version = "0.2.1"
        - Created __init__ file for function imports
        - Documentation on importing pywrangle
        - Added numpy as required package.
        - Changed package requirements to greater than or equal to.
        
        ## version = "0.0.1"
        - Init

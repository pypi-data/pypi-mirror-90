Description: # cached-virustotal-api
        
        A cached extension of the official [Python client](https://github.com/VirusTotal/vt-py) for VirusTotal.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Create the CachedClient like so:
        ```python
        from kfinny.cachedvt import CachedClient
        
        client = CachedClient(<apikey>, cache_dir=<some folder>)
        ```
        
        The folder does not need to exist, but if it does, it should be empty or a prior cache from this library. The cache is 
        sqlite database created by [DiskCache](https://github.com/grantjenks/python-diskcache).
        
        The client may be used just as it is documented by the [vt-py](https://virustotal.github.io/vt-py/index.html) project. 
        The codebase "adds" a single function to the client API, `yield_file_report` and can take a list of hashes.
        ```python
        # yield_file_report
        hashes = [<list of md5,sha1,sha256 hashes>]
        
        for obj in client.yield_file_report(hashes):
            assert(obj.type == 'file')
            print(f'{obj.md5} : {obj.sha1} : {obj.sha256}')
        ```
        
        Files not found on VirusTotal are not returned, but they are cached, since the whole point of this library is to conserve
        quota.
        ```python
        >>> hits, misses = client.cache.stats()
        >>> reports = list(client.yield_file_report('abcd'*16))
        >>> reports
        []
        >>> _hits, _misses = client.cache.stats()
        >>> assert(_misses - misses == 1)
        >>>
        ```

# HyperTag

File organization made easy. HyperTag let's humans intuitively express how they think about their files using tags.

## Install
Available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/hypertag/)

`$ pip install hypertag`

## Overview
HyperTag offers a slick CLI but more importantly it creates a directory called ```HyperTagFS``` which is a file system based representation of your files and tags using symbolic links and directories.

**Directory Import**: Import your existing directory hierarchies using ```$ hypertag import path/to/directory```. HyperTag converts it automatically into a tag hierarchy using metatagging.

**Semantic Search  (Experimental)**: Search through all your text documents (yes, even PDF's) content. This function is powered by the awesome [Sentence Transformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) library.

**HyperTag Daemon  (Experimental)**: Monitors `HyperTagFS` for user changes. Currently supports file and directory (tag) deletions + directory (name as query) creation with automatic query result population. Also spawns the DaemonService which speeds up semantic search significantly.

**Fuzzy Matching Queries**: HyperTag uses fuzzy matching to minimize friction in the unlikely case of a typo.

**File Type Groups**: HyperTag automatically creates folders containing common files (e.g. Images: jpg, png, etc., Documents: txt, pdf, etc., Source Code: py, js, etc.), which can be found in ```HyperTagFS```.

**HyperTag Graph**: Quickly get an overview of your HyperTag Graph! HyperTag visualizes the metatag graph on every change and saves it at `HyperTagFS/hypertag-graph.pdf`.

## CLI Functions

### Import existing directory recursively
Import files with tags inferred from the existing directory hierarchy

```$ hypertag import path/to/directory```

### Tag file/s
Manually tag files

```$ hypertag tag humans/*.txt with human "Homo Sapiens"```

### Untag file/s
Manually remove tag/s from file/s

```$ hypertag untag humans/*.txt with human "Homo Sapiens"```

### Tag a tag
Metatag tag/s to create tag hierarchies

```$ hypertag metatag human with animal```

### Merge tags
Merge all associations (files & tags) of tag A into tag B

```$ hypertag merge human into "Homo Sapiens"```

### Query using Set Theory
Print file names of the resulting set matching the query. Queries are composed of tags and operands. Tags are fuzzy matched for convenience. Nesting is currently not supported, queries are evaluated from left to right

Print paths: ```$ hypertag query human --path```<br>
Print fuzzy matched tag: ```$ hypertag query man --verbose``` <br>
Disable fuzzy matching: ```$ hypertag query human --fuzzy=0```

Default operand is AND (intersection): <br>
```$ hypertag query human "Homo Sapiens"```

OR (union): <br>
```$ hypertag query human or "Homo Sapiens"```

MINUS (difference): <br>
```$ hypertag query human minus "Homo Sapiens"```

### Index available text files
Only indexed files can be searched.

```$ hypertag index```

### Semantic search indexed text files
Print file names sorted by matching score.
Performance benefits greatly from the HyperTag daemon running.

Signal importance of search terms using stars (*):<br>```$ hypertag search "your ***'important text' query"```

### Print all tags of file/s

```$ hypertag tags filename1 filename2```

### Print all metatags of tag/s

```$ hypertag metatags tag1 tag2```

### Print all tags

```$ hypertag show```

### Print all files

Print names:
```$ hypertag show files```

Print paths:
```$ hypertag show files --path```

### Visualize HyperTag Graph
Visualize the metatag graph hierarchy (saved at HyperTagFS root)

```$ hypertag graph```

Specify [layout algorithm](https://igraph.org/python/doc/tutorial/tutorial.html#layout-algorithms) (default: fruchterman_reingold):

```$ hypertag graph --layout=kamada_kawai```

### Generate HyperTagFS
Generate file system based representation of your files and tags using symbolic links and directories

```$ hypertag mount```

### Start HyperTag daemon
Start daemon process with dual function:
- Watch HyperTagFS directory for user changes
- Spawn DaemonService to load and expose model used for semantic search

```$ hypertag daemon```

### Set HyperTagFS directory path
Default is the user's home directory

```$ hypertag set_hypertagfs_dir path/to/directory```

## Architecture
- Python powers HyperTag
- Many other awesome open-source projects make HyperTag possible (listed in `pyproject.toml`)
- SQLite3 serves as the meta data storage engine (located at `~/.config/hypertag/hypertag.db`)
- Symbolic links are used to create the HyperTagFS directory structure

## Development
- Clone repo: ```$ git clone https://github.com/SeanPedersen/HyperTag.git```
- `$ cd HyperTag/`
- Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
- Install dependencies: `$ poetry install`
- Activate virtual environment: `$ poetry shell`
- Run all tests: ```$ pytest -v```
- Run formatter: ```$ black hypertag/```
- Run linter: ```$ flake8```
- Run type checking: ```$ mypy **/*.py```
- Run security checking: ```$ bandit --exclude tests/ -r .```
- Run HyperTag: ```$ python -m hypertag```

## Inspiration

**What is the point of HyperTag's existence?**<br/>
HyperTag offers many unique features such as the import, semantic search, graphing and fuzzy matching functions that make it very convenient to use. All while HyperTag's code base staying tiny at <1000 LOC in comparison to TMSU (>10,000 LOC) and SuperTag (>25,000 LOC), making it easy to hack on.

This project is partially inspired by these open-source projects:
- [TMSU](https://github.com/oniony/TMSU): Written in Go
- [SuperTag](https://github.com/amoffat/supertag): Written in Rust

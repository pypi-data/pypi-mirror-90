2.0.0 (2021-01-04)
------------------

- prepare dependency cleanup. This release will remove object from the
  database. The core will stay intact We only remove the remote processing and
  search indexes. The next release will remove the packages from the release.

- simplify implementation. We go back to the roots and provide a simply
  pypi index server. The focus right now is providing a functional pypi
  server including p01.build projects. The important part ight now is to
  use the new warehouse api and replace the xml rpx api which has rate limits.

- removed remote processor and package mirror background job from zodb

- removed indexer and indexes from zodb


1.5.1 (2018-06-21)
------------------

- feature: added support for xml rpc proxy used for fetch package information

- added simple test page for xml rpc proxy setup. See Test menu tab. This page
  will fetch package names from pypi via xml rpc and list the amount of fetched
  package names using the pypi url site setup.


1.5.0 (2018-06-05)
------------------

- feature: added proxy support for download packages using a proxy. Switch from
  urllib to requests.

- feature: added favicon.ico image and view


1.4.0 (2018-05-16)
------------------

- updated package versions

- bugfix: switched from z3c.recipe.paster:serve to p01.recipe.setup recipe.

  You need to rename the following [app] section in your app.cfg;

    site.zcml to zcml
    zope.conf to conf

  because the new paster script requires a different naming.

  rename:

    [app]
    recipe = z3c.recipe.paster:serve
    eggs = mypypi
    ini = ...
    zope.conf = ...
    site.zcml = ...

  to:

    [app]
    recipe = p01.recipe.setup:paste
    eggs = mypypi
    ini = ...
    conf = ...
    zcml = ...

- bugfix versions, update some package versions because some package where not
  fixed to a version e.g. >

- feature: use new fsstorage which uses a relative path. This allows to move
  the mypypi installation without to break the file reference. Added generation
  for evolve database and migrate existing storage.

- feature: allow to upload a file to a miror release and enable the release
  upload menu

- adjust MANIFEST.in file

- needs more work, switch to p01.publisher and testing environment.
  The current used zope.testbrowser with version 5.0.0 changed the test browser
  setup. We need to rewrite the browser tests. Currently the browser tests are
  disabled.


1.3.0 (2013-05-31)
------------------

- switch to new zope.app.testing which is compatible with py 2.7 xmlrpclib and
  adjust test storage path which was not compatible with new test runner setup.

- switch to newer ZODB3 release version 3.10.5 which is available for
  python 2.6/2.7 on windows for 32/64 bit.

- bugfix: broken release update because of hard coded http uri. Switched
  to https uri and make them editable at site and mirror package release.
  Currently there is no auto migration. Just edit the pypi url in the site
  edit page and in the package edit page before update a package.

- commit transaction between package downloads


1.2.1 (2012-1-18)
-----------------

- implemented public file management table including public file delete

- bugfix: include missing public.zcml (adjust MANIFEST.in)


1.2.0 (2012-07-02)
------------------

- added MANIFEST.in file

- enhance batch size for simpler navigation

- added an additional ++public++ namspace for public file managment. This is
  usefull for upload KGS files which can't get downloaded within authentication
  if you need to use them as buildout extends.
  Note, since zc.buildout processes extends before extensions, there is no
  way to patch the buildout Downloader class and inject authentication. This
  also means lovely.builouthttp doesn't work for extends.

- bugfix: missing docutils if not installed in system python. Also newer
  docutils version do not provide python.modulparser.py anymore. Implement the
  missing trim_docstring method in mypypi/api.py


1.1.0 (2011-01-05)
------------------

- bugfix: fix sync error if we try to sync LocalPackage. Note, only
  MirrorPackage can get synced

- skip old zope.app.* packages and added zopeupdate script. Run the following
  script:

  bin\zodbupdate.exe -f ......\Data.fs -v --pack > out.txt 2>&1

- moved storage configuration from WSGI config to zope product config since
  someone broke the WSGI local_conf to zope product configuration chain.
  And we also changed the fsStorage argument to storage since camel case also
  seems to be broken.

  NOTE: You need to run configure.py and buildout before you start the
        server!

  Otherwise the server wdoesn't start because of the misssing storage
  configuration. (nothing dangerous happens)

- added a second concept for look a release to a single pypi server using the
  .pypirc configuration file. See README.txt for more information

- use newer zope.* packages

- implemented XML-RPC API like pypi.python.org offers. We currently do only
  support the important methods like:

  - list_packages

  - package_releases

  - package_urls # deprecated

  - release_urls

  - package_data # deprecated

  - release_data

  we do not support the methods (search, updated_releases, changelog) right now
  Note: you need to use a domain like http://host:port/ as XML-RPC ServerProxy
  url. If you don't use the slash a the end the ServerProxy uses /RPC2 as
  default handler which isn't supported by mypypi.

- removed temporary MultiWidget and TextLinesWidget because I move them
  to the z3c.form 2.0 release which is now used

- moved management pages from browser to admin package

- imporved configuration script, use getpass for password input and adjust text
  message

- bugfix, added explicit find-link for lovely.buildouthttp, couldn't find the
  package during a fresh installation.

- bugfix, added missing buildout.cfg file, same issue as in version 1.0.1.
  This issue was reported 5 month ago but still not fixed see:
  http://bugs.python.org/issue6884


1.0.3 (2010-11-02)
------------------

- bugfix, version conflict. Use ZTK 1.0 and zopeapp-versions 1.0 as base versions

- bugifx, dash vs underscore madness. The package wsgi_intercept at python
  offers a download link to google which defines wsgi-intercept (_ vs -) e.g.
  http://pypi.python.org/simple/wsgi_intercept/
  http://code.google.com/p/wsgi-intercept/

- fix typo (sh1 -> sha1) in configure.py script


1.0.2 (2010-06-21)
------------------

- cleanup buildou.cfg and base.cfg files


1.0.1 (2010-06-17)

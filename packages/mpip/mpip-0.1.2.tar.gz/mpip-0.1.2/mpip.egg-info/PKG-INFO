Description: `mpip` ("managed pip") is a thin wrapper around pip that helps you manage your `requirements.txt` file.
        
        ### Installation
        ```bash
        pip install mpip
        ```
        
        ### Basic Usage
        ```bash
        mpip install django # adds "django" to your requirements file
        mpip install django==3.1.5 # adds "django==3.1.5" to your requirements file
        mpip uninstall django # removes any version of django from your requirements file 
        ```
        
        For more detailed usage information, see `mpip --help`. 
        
        The CLI is built using [`python-fire`](https://github.com/google/python-fire), so for more details about the specific mechanics of argument parsing, that would be the first place to look. Generally speaking, it will try to parse arguments as python objects, e.g.
        `--quiet True`
        
        ### Features
        * Creates `requirements.txt` if one is not detected
        * Handles pip versioning semantics such as `<`, `>`, `>=`, `==`
        * Deletes `requirements.txt` if all requirements have been uninstalled

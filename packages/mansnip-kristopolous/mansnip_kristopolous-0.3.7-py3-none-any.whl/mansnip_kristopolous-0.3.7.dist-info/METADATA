**Don't you hate** wasting time navigating through manpages with the leading pager's clunky search tools?

Ever try to find things like the "declare" built-in in `bash(1)` only to slodge through the results using the 'n' key going 'nope, nope, nope'? 

![the old way](http://i.9ol.es/animate.gif)

Stop wasting time with the old way of manually stumbling through manuals. Say goodbye to these problems once and for all!

**Finally there's a better way!**

## Introducting Mansnip! 

Mansnip is a revolutionary way to navigate through manpages, a tool that no terminal should be without!

It intelligently searches through manpages and outputs the snippets relevant to your query as self-contained browsable sections. 
Simply use it the way you use man, at the command line, followed by your search term(s).

Watch how mansnip can immediately find `bash(1)'s` declare without any extra effort:

Mansnip works on any manpage.

**With mansnip** you'll just zip through documentation, saving precious time so you can write GitHub readmes like you're trying to sell Ginsu steak knives.

See how mansnip obediently shows everything with a "-z" option in the 25,888 lines of the [zshall manpage](http://gsp.com/cgi-bin/man.cgi?section=1&topic=zshall) on a single screen, all at once, in an easy-to-read manner.

But wait, there's more! You'll also get the line number and hierarchical context totally free!

*We're still not finished yet!*

You'll also get to install it easily [through pypi](https://pypi.org/project/mansnip-kristopolous/). 

Here's how do it 

`$ pip3 install mansnip-kristopolous` 

Act now, servers are standing by.

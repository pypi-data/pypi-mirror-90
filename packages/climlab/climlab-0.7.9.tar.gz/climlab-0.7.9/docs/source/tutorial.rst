Below is a collection of Jupyter notebooks giving example usage of the ``climlab`` package.
These notebooks are based on classroom material developed by Brian Rose at the University at Albany.
For a more comprehensive set of examples and graduate-level lecture notes,
`click here <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/brian-rose/ClimateModeling_courseware/blob/master/index.ipynb>`_.

The notebooks can be viewed on `nbviewer <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org>`_ through the links below. If you want to run the code yourself, these notes are all available as Jupyter *.ipynb files
in the ``courseware`` directory of the `climlab source <https://github.com/brian-rose/climlab>`_.

#-----------------
Overview of the function risk_normalization:

The risk normalization consits of two phases:
1.  Compute the maximum fraction of the trading account
    that can be used to take a position in the tradable issue
    without exceeding the personal risk tolerance of the
    trader.  This is called "safe-f"
2.  Using safe-f as a position size, compute the profit
    potential for the forecast period.  Convert the gain
    to Compound Annual rate of Return, called "CAR25"

Begin with a set of trades.  These are analyzed as is to compute
safe-f, and are assumed to be the best estimate of future 
performance.  This set does not change throughout the procedure.

Set the fraction an initial value of 1.00
    Create many equally likely equity curves,
        measure the maximum drawdown of each,
        keep them in a list.
    Treat the list of max drawdowns as a distribution
        and determine the maximum drawdown at the high
        risk tail -- probably at the 95th percentile.
    Compare the trader's personal risk tolerance with
        the tail risk of the distribution.
        If they are equal, the current value of the
        fraction is safe-f.
        If they are not equal, adjust the fraction and 
        repeat.

safe-f has been established.

Using safe-f as the fraction
    Create many equally likely equity curves,
        measure the final equity,
        keep that in a list.
    Treat the list of final equity as a distribution
        and determine the equity at the 25th percentile.
    Convert the relative gain in equity to a 
        compound annual rate of return.
        That value is car25.

Return safe-f and CAR25
#-----------------

Assumptions
  A trade list has been created by some process.
    It could be live trades, validation trades, in-sample trades,
    or hypothetical trades.
  Each trade represents the gain in equity of a single day,
    resulting from a trade on that day,
    such as the change in price from today's close to tomorrow's
    close.
A gain of 1% is represented as 0.0100
A day where the position is flat has a gain of 0.0000
There are about 252 trades per year
The account is marked to market daily.
The account is managed daily.
The trader is able and willing to change position daily.

Use:

                    number_repetitions
                  )

Parameters:
  trades:  The set of trades to evaluate.
      Expecting a numpy array with one dimension.
  number_days_in_forecast:  the forecast period.
      504 for a forecast of 2 years.
  number_trades_in_forecast:
      The number of trades to draw for each equity sequence.
        Same as number_days_in_forecast if
          marking to market and trading daily.
        A smaller number if trade data
          represents multiday holding.
  initial_capital:  initial amount in the trading account.
      Typical = $100,000.00
  tail_percentile:  The percentile at which to measure the
      tail risk.  Typical = 5  => the 95th percentile
      of the CDF.
  drawdown_tolerance:  The traders drawdown tolerance.
      Expressed as a proportion of maximum equity to date.
      Typical = 0.10  A 10% drawdown.
  number_equity_in_CDF:  The number of equity curves used
      to compute a single CDF.  Typical = 1000
  number_repetitions:  Number of simulations to combine
      to compute mean and standard deviation.  Typical = 10

Returns:
  safe_f:  The fraction of the trading account that will be
      used for each trade.
  safe_f_stdev:  standard deviation of safe_f calculations.     
  CAR25:  The compound annual rate of return for the given
      set of trades and position size.
  CAR25_stdev:  standard deviation of CAR25 calculations.

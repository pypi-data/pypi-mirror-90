#### Installing
aionasa can be installed from pypi with the command:
```sh
# Linux
python3 -m pip install -U aionasa

# Windows
python -m pip install -U aionasa
```

To install the development version of the library directly from source:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/nwunderly/aionasa
$ cd aionasa
$ python3 -m pip install -U .
```

#### Quickstart
We'll be using IPython because it supports `await` expressions directly from the console.
```sh
$ pip install aionasa ipython
$ ipython
```

```python
from aionasa import APOD, InSight

async with APOD() as apod:
    picture = await apod.get()

picture.url # this will be the most recent APOD image URL.

async with InSight() as insight:
    data = await insight.get()

data # this will be a dict containing the JSON data returned by the API.
```

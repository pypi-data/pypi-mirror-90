This Python package contains useful functionality for supporting automated geotechnical calculations.

Functionality for onshore and offshore geotechnical problems is included. This package is under constant
development so any request for additional functionality can always be submitted to the package author.

groundhog bundles a large amount of knowledge and provides it to end users through extensively documented functions. The aim of the package is as follows:

   - Improve correctness through unit-tested functions with parameter validation
   - Raise awareness on underlying test data and theories supporting engineering correlations and design formulae
   - Promoting development of open-source engineering software by the worldwide community of engineers

groundhog is developed using a set of 10 Golden rules which are reflected in the groundhog function
architecture and should also be followed by any contributors to the project.

For more information, consult the [documentation](http://snakesonabrain.com/docs/groundhog/index.html) or get started using the [tutorial notebooks](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/snakesonabrain/groundhog/master).

Installation requirements
-------------------------

groundhog is written for Python 3.7+. Downloading Anaconda3 is recommended for users not familiar with Python development.
Plotting functionality included in the package is built on plotly. The plotly package also needs to be installed and
is not included in the default Anaconda installation.

Installing groundhog is easily done with pip:`

```
pip install groundhog
```

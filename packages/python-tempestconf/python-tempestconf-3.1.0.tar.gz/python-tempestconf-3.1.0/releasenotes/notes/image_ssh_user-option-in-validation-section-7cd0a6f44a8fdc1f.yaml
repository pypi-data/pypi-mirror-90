    validation.image_sh_user option is heavily used in CI and it's also needed
    in refstack. Therefor the value is set to cirros automatically from now
    everytime when image used is cirros.
    The hardcoded value in default-overrides.conf is removed.

    By this change compute.image_ssh_user is removed from
    default-overrides.conf too, because it was deprecated. All of the
    image_ssh_user values from different sections were moved to validation
    section by this change:

    Since that change, there is only one image_ssh_user value and it's the one
    under validation section.

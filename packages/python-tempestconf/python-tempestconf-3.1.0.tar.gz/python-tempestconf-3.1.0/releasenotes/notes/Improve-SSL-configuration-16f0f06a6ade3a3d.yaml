    discover-tempest-config can now automatically set the following 2 tempest
    options:
    * CONF.identity.disable_ssl_certificate_validation
    * CONF.identity.ca_certificates_file
    The mentioned options are set based on cloud's request verify arguments
    (verify and cert) read (either set as environent variables or passed via
    CLI) by openstack package.

    Passing a value from --insecure argument is fixed. Previously --insecure
    didn't have any effect on discover-tempest-config and its behavior which
    lead to failing requests due to certificates verify failures. That is fixed
    now. Now the --insecure's value will be stored in the internal Credentials
    class and safely pased in requests querying the cloud.

    Because of integration of the tool with refstack-client a new parameter,
    --create-accounts-file, is added. The parameter defines a path where
    a minimal accounts.yaml file will be created.
    The accounts.yaml file is important in refstack testing, because the tests
    are run with non admin credentials. Therefor to make it easier for refstack
    users, if a user doesn't specify a path to an existing accounts.yaml file
    (via test_accounts parameter), but uses a create_accounts_file
    instead, the file will be created in the specified location and set to
    the tempest.conf as test_accounts_file under auth section.
    For this feature a new requirement is specified - PyYAML.

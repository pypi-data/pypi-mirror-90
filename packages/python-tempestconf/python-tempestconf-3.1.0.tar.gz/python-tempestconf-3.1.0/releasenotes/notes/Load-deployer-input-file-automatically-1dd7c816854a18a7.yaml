    The deployer-input file will be loaded automatically if exists in the
    default path, which is ~/tempest-deployer-input.conf.
    This will fix the cases that user forgot to add --deployer-input and
    python-tempestconf forgot some configuration due of that.
    Also a new argument (--no-default-deployer) is added, which will make
    python-tempestconf not to load the file automatically.

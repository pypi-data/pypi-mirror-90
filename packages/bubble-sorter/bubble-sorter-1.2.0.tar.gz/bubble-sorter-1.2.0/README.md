# Bubble Sort Python

Bubble Sort Python is a Python module for dealing with bubble sort needs in python. Although python already has an in-built sort mechanism â€” `sort()` I thought this would be a fun project!

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Bubble Sort Python.

```bash
pip install bubble-sorter
```

## Usage

```python
import bubble_sorter

bubble_sorter.sort(2, 1, 3, 19, 8, 4) # returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 19]
bubble_sorter.sort('goose', 'duck', 'cow', 'chicken', 'horse') # returns ['chicken', 'cow', 'duck', 'goose', 'horse']

```

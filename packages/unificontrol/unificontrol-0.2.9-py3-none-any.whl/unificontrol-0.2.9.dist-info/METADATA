A high-level Python interface to the Unifi controller software
==============================================================

unificontrol is a rich and full-featured Python interface to the
Ubiquiti Unifi software defined network controller. Goals of this package
include:

- A clean interface that supports introspection and self-documentation.
- A complete implementation of the Unifi controller API. Currently it supports over 100 API calls to the Unifi controller.
- Proper handling of SSL connections to allow secure access to the controller even when the controller uses a [self-signed certificate](ssl_self_signed.md).
- A concise, readable internal representation of the Unifi API, so that new API calls can easily be added as new features are added to the controller.
- Python 3 only, since it's the way of the future.

Documentation
-------------

The `unificontrol` code aims to be self-documenting as far as possible so if you are using it in an interactive environment the built in Python `help()` function will often tell you what you need.

There is also documentation that can be built using Sphynx in the `docs` directory and a built version of these docs is `hosted on ReadTheDocs <https://unificontrol.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

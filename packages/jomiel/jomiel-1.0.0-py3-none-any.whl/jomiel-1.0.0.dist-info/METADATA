`jomiel` is the meta inquiry middleware for distributed systems. It
returns data about content on [video-sharing] websites (e.g. YouTube).

Two core technologies serve as a basis for `jomiel`:

- [Protocol Buffers] for platform-independent data serialization
- [ZeroMQ] as the messaging library

The client applications can be written in modern [languages][examples]
for most platforms.

`jomiel` is a spiritual successor to (now defunct) [libquvi].

![Example (jomiel)](./docs/demo.svg)

## Features

- Language and platform neutral messaging using [Protocol Buffers] and
  [ZeroMQ]

- A plugin architecture for extending [video-sharing] website support

- Authentication and encryption ([CURVE] and [SSH])

- Runs fully as a service

- Highly configurable

## Getting started

- `jomiel` requires [Python] 3.6+

To install from [PyPI]:

```shell
pip install jomiel
```

To run from the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/guendto/jomiel.git
cd jomiel
pip install -e .
```

Once you have `jomiel` running, you
can try sending inquiries with:

- [examples] - the demo programs written in most modern languages
- [yomiel] - the pretty printer for `jomiel` messages

Be sure to check out the [HOWTO](./docs/HOWTO.md#howto-jomiel), also.

## Website coverage

To view the list of the supported [video-sharing] websites, type:

```shell
jomiel --plugin-list
```

The website coverage is still very limited.

- Additional support can be added by writing new plugins
- The plugin architechture is implemented in [Python]
- [Python] is a fun and easy language to learn

See the `src/jomiel/plugin/` directory for the existing plugins.

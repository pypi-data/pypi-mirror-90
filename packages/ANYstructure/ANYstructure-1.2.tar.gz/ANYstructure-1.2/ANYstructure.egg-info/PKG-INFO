Description: ============
        ANYstructure
        ============
        
        ANYstructure is a GUI based steel dimesion calculation and weight optimization tool intended for naval architects.
        It is based on DNVGL-OS-C101 Design of offshore steel structures, general - LRFD method.
        
        The following is caluculated:
        
        * Minimum section module for stiffener
        * Minimum plate thickness
        * Buckling capacity (DNV-RP-C201 Buckling Strength of Plated Structures)
        * Plate/stiffener connection fatigue (DNV-RP-C203: Fatigue Design of Offshore Steel Structures)
        * Bow slamming according to DNVGL ship rules
        
        In an optimization process all these can be acconuted for or individually turned off.
        
        Loads are defined as follows:
        
        * External surface loads defined by polynominal equations
        * Tank loads are calculated automatically
        
        Loads are combined according to DNVGL-OS-C101.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The easiest way to install the package is via pip::
        
            $ pip install anystructure
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        An entry point is defined. After installing on PIP, just type "ANYstructure" in the command window.
        
        Alternatively run \_\_main\_\_.py

Installation
============


Stable release
--------------

`pip`_ is the preferred method to install CoPrA, as it will always install the most recent stable release. To install CoPrA and its dependencies, run this command in your terminal application:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install copra

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io

From sources
------------

Alternatively, the source code for the CoPrA package can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

You can either clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/tpodlaski/copra

Or download the `tarball`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl  -OL https://github.com/tpodlaski/copra/tarball/master

Once you have a copy of the source, un-zipped and un-tarred if you downloaded the tarball, you can install it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py install


.. _Github repo: https://github.com/tpodlaski/copra
.. _tarball: https://github.com/tpodlaski/copra/tarball/master

# Can I Use Python 3?

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brettcannon/caniusepython3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/brettcannon/caniusepython3)

You can read the documentation on how to use caniusepython3 from its
[PyPI page](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/caniusepython3). A [web interface](https://github.com/jezdez/caniusepython3.com)
is also available.

# How do you tell if a project has been ported to Python 3?

On [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/) each project can specify various
[trove classifiers](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=list_classifiers)
(typically in a project's `setup.py` through a [`classifier`](https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html#additional-meta-data)
argument to `setup()`).
There are various classifiers related to what version of Python a project can
run on. E.g.:

    Programming Language :: Python :: 3
    Programming Language :: Python :: 3.0
    Programming Language :: Python :: 3.1
    Programming Language :: Python :: 3.2
    Programming Language :: Python :: 3.3
    Programming Language :: Python :: 3.4
    Programming Language :: Python :: 3.5
    Programming Language :: Python :: 3.6
    Programming Language :: Python :: 3.7

As long as a trove classifier for some version of Python 3 is specified then the
project is considered to support Python 3 (project owners: it is preferred you
**at least** specify `Programming Language :: Python :: 3` as that is how you
end up listed on the [Python 3 Packages list on PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=packages_rss);
you can represent Python 2 support with `Programming Language :: Python`). Note
that Python 3.0 through 3.4 have reached their [End Of Life](https://docs.python.org/devguide/index.html#branchstatus).

The other way is through a [manual override](https://github.com/brettcannon/caniusepython3/blob/master/caniusepython3/overrides.json) in
`caniusepython3` itself. Projects ends up on this list because:

- They are now part of [Python's standard library](http://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html) in some release of Python 3
- Their Python 3 port is under a different name
- They are missing a Python 3 trove classifier but have actually been ported

If any of these various requirements are met, then a project is considered to
support Python 3 and thus will be added to the manual overrides list. You can
see the list of overrides when you use caniusepython3's CLI with verbose output
turned on.

## What if I know of a project that should be added to the overrides file?

If a project has Python 3 support in a release on PyPI but they have not added the
proper trove classifier, then either submit a
[pull request](https://github.com/brettcannon/caniusepython3/pulls) or file an
[issue](https://github.com/brettcannon/caniusepython3/issues) with the name of the
project and a link to some proof that a release available on PyPI has indeed been
ported (e.g. PyPI page stating the support, tox.ini file showing tests being run
against Python 3, etc.). Projects that have Python 3 support in their version control
system but not yet available on PyPI will **not** be considered for inclusion in the
overrides file.

# How can I get a project ported to Python 3?

Typically projects which have not switched to Python 3 yet are waiting for:

- A dependency to be ported to Python 3
- Someone to volunteer to put in the time and effort to do the port

Since `caniusepython3` will tell you what dependencies are blocking a project
that you depend on from being ported, you can try to port a project farther
down your dependency graph to help a more direct dependency make the transition.

Which brings up the second point: volunteering to do a port. Most projects
happily accept help, they just have not done the port yet because they have
not had the time ("volunteering" can also take the form of paying someone to do
the port on your behalf). Some projects are simply waiting for people to ask for it,
so even speaking up politely and requesting a port can get the process started.

If you are looking for help to port a project, you can always search online for
various sources of help. If you want a specific starting point there are
[HOWTOs](http://docs.python.org/3/howto/index.html) in the Python documentation
on [porting pure Python modules](http://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html)
and [extension modules](http://docs.python.org/3/howto/cporting.html).

# Can I use it as a pre-commit hook?

Yes! Begin by installing [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/):

```
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

You can add the following hook in your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.

```yaml
    - repo: https://github.com/brettcannon/caniusepython3
      rev: v7.1.0  # Update as desired to new releases/tags
      hooks:
          - id: caniusepython3
            files: requirements\.txt$  # Update to match your requirements files accordingly.
            args: [
                -r  # Causes caniusepython3 to treat the `files` argument as a requirements file.
          ]
            stages: [commit]  # Change it to `manual`, if `caniusepython3` takes too long between commits, so as to only run them manually in build jobs.
```

If you are running manually somewhere, we can run the following command:

```
pre-commit run --hook-stage manual caniusepython3 --files  requirements.txt
```

AWS flock
=========

`flock`-like functionality for applications in AWS, using dynamodb as a
backend for synchronization.

A simple CLI, on-par with the classic `flock` tool for synchronizing
applications.

Use Cases
---------

- Synchronizing multiple automated jobs across workers in AWS
- Writing scripts that only one human operator can be running at a time (e.g.
  production deployment tools with terraform, CFN, etc)
- Synchronizing jobs in non-AWS systems (e.g. GitHub Actions) using AWS
  credentials

Behavior / Model
----------------

Locks are held for a limited period of time.
After that time, if not renewed, the lock expires and another worker may reclaim
the lock.
While the lock is held, the worker holding it has a "lease" on the lock, proven
by a given `LEASE_ID`.
A `LEASE_ID` can be used to "renew" or "release" a given lock.

`awsflock` requires a table in DynamoDB to store active locks.
By default, the table name is `awsflock`, but custom names can be used.
You must create the table before locks can be used (it will never be created
automatically).
Locks are identified by name, and those names are unique keys into the
`awsflock` table.

Locks have a limited lifetime (default: 2 hours) if not explicitly released,
after which they may be "reclaimed" by anyone trying to acquire that lock.

.. note::

    Local clock time is compared against lock expirations to determine whether
    or not reclamation may be tried. The default reclamation window (5 seconds)
    is more than sufficient for most use-cases, but assumes that your clocks
    are synchronized by NTP or a similar protocol. Usage where clocks cannot be
    trusted may result in incorrect lock reclamations.

When you acquire a lock, you get back a `LEASE_ID`. The `LEASE_ID` can then be
used to renew the lock or release it. In this way, locks are held by a single
owner for a limited period of time, and the `LEASE_ID` constitutes proof of
ownership.

Usage
-----

Full usage info can be found with `awsflock --help`.

Acquire a lock, with a 15 minute expiration, and get the lock `LEASE_ID`:

.. code-block:: bash

    LEASE_ID="$(awsflock acquire LockFoo --expiration 900)"

Renew the lock, getting back the new `LEASE_ID` and reducing the expiration
window to 5 minutes:

.. code-block:: bash

    LEASE_ID="$(awsflock renew LockFoo "$LEASE_ID" --expiration 300)"

Release the lock, so that others may use it:

.. code-block:: bash

    awsflock release LockFoo "$LEASE_ID"

Attempt to acquire another lock, but don't block and wait for it to be
acquired:

.. code-block:: bash

    LEASE_ID="$(awsflock acquire LockBar --no-wait)"
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
      # lock acquired ...
    else
      # lock not acquired ...
    fi

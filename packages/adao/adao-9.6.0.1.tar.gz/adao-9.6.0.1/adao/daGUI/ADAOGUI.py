"""
This python file provides the implementation of the interface of the GUI part of
this SALOME module. This interface is required by the SALOME GUI framework.
We use here a proxy module named under the alias GuiImpl for at least three
reasons:
1. To Keep the required interface as clear as possible in this file;
2. The concrete implementation can be substituted by an alternative version;
3. We could mix several concrete implementations provided by different proxy
   modules, for example for test purposes.

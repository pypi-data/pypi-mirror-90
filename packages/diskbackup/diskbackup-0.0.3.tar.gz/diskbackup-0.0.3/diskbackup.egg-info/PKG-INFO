Description: # diskbackup
        
        **diskbackup** is a very simple backup tool. Main features:
        
        * The directory `dest` will be a clone of `src` (and its subdirectories). New files or modified files will be copied, and files in `dest` which are not in `src` will be removed.
        
        * The backup is incremental: only new or modified files will be copied. `filename` + `file size` + `modification time` are used to do the comparison between source and destination files.
        
        * Supports exclude patterns (case insensitive)
        
        * Follows symbolic links
        
        * Works when the `dest` is a network shared folder (tested on Windows)
        
        * The source code is ~50 lines of code: you don't even need to scroll in your text editor to read the code, it takes only one page ;)
        
        ## Installation and usage
        
        You need Python 3.6+, and to do:
        
            pip install diskbackup
        
        (An alternative installation method is to just copy the single file `diskbackup.py` where you want to use it.)
        
        This is how to use it:
        
            from diskbackup import backup
            backup(src=r'd:\docs', dest=r'i:\docs')                  
            backup(src=r'd:\docs', dest=r'i:\docs', fake=True)   # fake run, no change on destination
            backup(src=r'd:\docs', dest=r'i:\docs', exclude=['excluded_dir', '.mp4'])

        A module that lets you monitor signals in a 
        `MyHDL <http://www.myhdl.org/>`_ or `nMigen <https://m-labs.hk/gateware/nmigen/>`_ digital system simulation
        and display them as waveforms in a Jupyter notebook.
        Make changes to your digital design and see the results reflected immediately in the
        waveforms of your notebook!
        
        `myhdlpeek` implements a `Peeker` object that monitors a signal and records
        the time and value when it changes.
        Just add multiple Peekers where you want to monitor something (even at sub-levels
        of a hierarchical design) and then view the collected timing waveforms
        with a single command.
        You can also select which signals are shown, set the beginning and
        ending times of the display, and much more.
        
        `[This Jupyter notebook] <https://github.com/xesscorp/myhdlpeek/blob/master/examples/complete.ipynb>`_ 
        shows how to use myhdlpeek.

        Features
        --------
        
        * Captures timing traces of signals in a MyHDL/nMigen digital design.
        * Works at the top-level and sub-levels of a hierarchical design.
        * All signals or a selected subset can be displayed.
        * The beginning and ending points of the waveform display can be set.
        * Timing marks can be turned on or off.
        * Titles and captions are supported.
        * Tabular output in Jupyter and console.
        * Trigger expressions allow the display of a selected portion of traces.
        
        
        
        
        History
        -------
        
        
        0.0.9 (2021-01-05)
        ______________________
        
        * Added support for nMigen.
        * Waveforms can now be drawn using wavedrom or matplotlib.
        
        
        0.0.8 (2018-09-25)
        ______________________
        
        * Now works with the newer JupyterLab by default. Older Jupyter notebooks are still supported by setting ``myhdlpeek.USE_JUPYTERLAB = False``.
        * Updated documentation.
        
        
        0.0.7 (2018-04-13)
        ______________________
        
        * Added functions to export signal traces into a Pandas dataframe.
        * Updated documentation.
        
        
        0.0.6 (2017-10-11)
        ______________________
        
        * The skin can now be set for waveform traces (either 'default' or 'narrow').
        * clear_traces() was added to remove signal trace data from Peekers without removing the Peekers so another simulation can be run.
        * Updated documentation.
        * Removed unused __main__.py.
        
        
        0.0.5 (2017-08-25)
        ______________________
        
        * Added PeekerGroup class to allow grouping of Peekers.
        * Trace objects now only return integer values.
        
        
        0.0.4 (2017-07-04)
        ______________________
        
        * Added trigger capability to select a portion of traces for display.
        * Extended waveform & table display to both Peekers and Traces.
        
        
        0.0.3 (2017-06-23)
        ______________________
        
        * Made compatible with Python 2.7.
        * Added tabular output of Peeker data traces.
        
        
        0.0.2 (2017-06-12)
        ______________________
        
        * Added static HTML pages to display what myhdlpeek can do. (Notebook rendering with nbconvert won't show waveforms.)
        
        
        0.0.1 (2017-06-10)
        ______________________
        
        * First release on PyPI.

Change Ringing Engine is a method ringing application for church bell
ringers. It works out all the rows of a method (plain course or touch,
displays them in a variety of formats and even rings them audibly on a
set of bell sample sound files. Change Ringing Engine uses a
traditional command line interface, but may be embedded as an API in
another application such as Bell View.

Installation instructions and a user manual are available on the
Harrogate Bell Ringers' website

<h1>Bell View</h1>

<p>
Bell View is a computer program for church bell ringers for
looking up methods and acts as a front end for CRE.
</p>
<p>
With Bell View, one can view methods with a nice blue line (or for
that matter any other coloured line), print them out, see what effect
bobs and singles have on the plain course and even hear how they
sound!

For more information, please refer to the Bell View manual. It is

<h1>Formatting and displaying methods and blocks (print)</h1>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>print <em>id</em> [<em>filename</em>]</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Methods and blocks may be displayed on the screen or saved to a
file using the print command.
</p>
<p>
If the given object id is a block, then it will display all the
rows of the block; whereas if the id is a method then it will display
one plain course of the method.
</p>

<h2>Displaying rows</h2>
<p>
Using print without a filename will display the block or method on the
screen. Trace lines on bells will not be generated; but instead the
bells will have emphasis as determined by
variable <em>traceformat</em>. For example:
</p>
<pre>CRE> print gs120</pre>
<p>
If the variable <em>pagerows</em> is set to <em>on</em>, then the rows
are displayed using the system pager (e.g. <em>less</em> on macOS) as
a single column with trace bells being displayed in bold
overstrike. It is therefore useful on legacy VT100 terminals without
scrolling.
</p>

<h2>Saving rows to a file</h2>
<p>
If a filename is supplied, then the output is written to that file. A
variety of different formats are available, depending on the filename
extension. For example:
</p>
<pre>CRE> print gs120 grandsire.html</pre>
<p>
The supported formats are:
</p>
<p>
Plain text (.txt). Output is similar to what is printed on the screen
</p>
<p>
HTML (.html). This uses scalable vector graphics to format the
tracelines and may be opened in most modern web browsers (e.g. Chrome
and Edge)
</p>
<p>
Comma separated value (.csv). This format is for importing into a
spreadsheet with each bell occupying a single cell. No trace lines are
produced
</p>
<p>
Postscript (.ps). Paged output is generated for postscript enabled
printers
</p>
<p>
Encapsulated Postscript (.eps). All the output is placed within a
single figure and is suitable for inclusion in a LaTeX document.
</p>
<p>
Portable Document Format (.pdf). PDF is for distribution in a
printable format. Rendering of PDF's requires a third party utility
Ghostscript
</p>
<p>
Portable Network Graphics (.png). PNG's are bitmap images that may be
embedded in web pages or in Microsoft Office documents. Producing
PNG's requires Ghostscript

<h1>Querying variables and objects (show)</h1>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>

<p>show [<em>name</em>]</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
The <p>show</p> command is used to query objects. What is printed out
depends on the type of object; for example to print the current value
of a variable:
</p>
<pre>
CRE> show tracebells
tracebells = 12
</pre>
<p>
Methods, blocks and towers may also be queried using <em>show</em>. In
this case, the full definition of each object is shown.
</p>
<p>
To get a list of all objects, use <em>show</em> without an
argument. Variable values are shown here, but for blocks, methods and
towers, only the names are shown.

<h1>Handling objects (delete, copy, rename)</h1>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>delete <em>object_id</em></p>
<p>copy <em>object_id</em> <em>new_object_id</em></p>
<p>rename <em>object_id</em> <em>new_object_id</em></p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
These commands handle user defined objects in CRE (blocks, methods, towers)
</p>

<p>
To remove an object from the workspace, use the <em>delete</em> command; for example
</p>
<pre>
CRE> delete grandsire5
</pre>

<p>
Objects may be copied by using <em>copy</em>; for example
</p>
<pre>
CRE> copy grandsire5 grandsire5b
</pre>
<p>
N.B. towers are not actually copied - this command assigns an
alternative identifier to it. However, blocks and methods are copied
in their entirety, so making changes to one of the copies will not
affect the other.
</p> 

<p>
Objects can also be renamed; for example
</p>
<pre>
CRE> rename fred freda
</pre>

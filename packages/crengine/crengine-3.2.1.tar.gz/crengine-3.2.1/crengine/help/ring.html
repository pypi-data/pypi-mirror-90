<h1>Ringing methods audibly (ring)</h1>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>ring <em>object_id</em> <em>tower_id</em></p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
To hear what a block (or a plain course of a method) sounds like, the
ring command may be used; for example to ring a plain course of
Grandsire Triples:
</p>
<pre>
CRE> tower wilf "Harrogate St Wilfrid"
CRE> method gs7 "Grandsire" 7
CRE> set cover on
CRE> ring gs7 wilf
</pre>
<p>
Touches, defined in blocks, may also be rung; for example:
</p>
<pre>
CRE> block gs168 "168 Grandsire Triples" 7 14
CRE> touch gs168 gs7 PPPB
CRE> repeat gs168
CRE> set cover on
CRE> ring gs168 wilf
</pre>
<p>
Ringing will stop at the end of the block (or if CTRL-C is pressed).
</p>
<p>
N.B. An error will occur if there are too few bells in the tower to
ring the specified block or method.

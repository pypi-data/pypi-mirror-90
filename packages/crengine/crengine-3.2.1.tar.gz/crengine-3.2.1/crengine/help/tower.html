<h1>Setting up sound of bells (tower)</h1>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>tower <em>tower_id</em> <em>name</em></p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
CRE has the capability to ring bells audibly using a set of bell
samples (referred to as a tower). Each tower consists of a set of bell
sound sample files in WAV format, to which CRE has the ability to
sequence them to ring methods (or even tunes!).
</p>
<p>
Sound rendering is platform dependent. At present it is supported
natively on Windows (winsound) and MacOS (Objective C library). It may
be also be made to work on other platforms, such as LINUX, using the
third party PyGame package.
</p>

<h2>Towers</h2>
<p>
Each tower consists of a subfolder within the <em>bellview3</em>
folder; for example, if Bell View is installed in
</p>
<pre>
/Users/fred/bellview3
</pre>
<p>
then the bell samples for <em>Harrogate St Wilfrid</em> (an 8 bell
tower, tenor 6cwt in C) are located in
</p>
<pre>
/Users/fred/bellview3/towers/Harrogate St Wilfrid
</pre>
<p>
In this folder are files 1.wav to 8.wav which are the samples for
bells 1 to 8 and a configuration file tower.csv
</p>

<h2>Using a tower</h2>
<p>
To use a tower in CRE, then it needs to be loaded into the workspace
and assigned to an identifier; for example, to use Harrogate St
Wilfrid and assign the identifier <em>wilf</em> to it:
</p>
<pre>
CRE> tower wilf "Harrogate St Wilfrid"
</pre>
<p>
Once a tower is loaded, it may be used by <em>ring</em> to ring
methods or by <em>chime</em> to play tunes. The tower may be tested by
chiming rounds on it:
</p>
<pre>
CRE> chime wilf 12345678
</pre>

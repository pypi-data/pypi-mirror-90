<h1>Defining Methods (method)</h1>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>method <em>ID</em> <em>NAME</em> [<em>NBELLS</em>]</p>
<p>method <em>ID</em> <em>NAME</em> <em>NBELLS</em> <em>PLAINLEAD</em>
[<em>CALLPOS</em> <em>BOB</em> <em>SINGLE</em>]</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The <em>method</em> command has two forms; the first for retrieving
a method from the CRE method library and the second for explicitly
defining a method from place notation</p>
<p>The first form is for using a method from the library. The method
may be identified either by using the full name e.g. "Plain Bob Minor"
or by specifying the root name e.g. "Plain Bob" and the number of
bells as an additional argument. For example:</p>
<pre>CRE> method pb5 "Plain Bob Minor"</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>CRE> method pb5 "Plain Bob" 6</pre>
<p>It is possible to use wildcards in the method name (? represents a
single character and * any number of characters; for example</p>
<pre>CRE> method pb5 "pla*bob" 6</pre>
<p>
will find Plain Bob Minor, provided there isn't another method that
matches this pattern, such as "Plane Bob"
</p>
<p>The second form is for defining a method from place notation; for
example to define Plain Bob Minor (without bobs and singles)</p>
<pre>CRE> method pb6 "Plain Bob" 6 &x16x16x16,12</pre>
<p>To use bobs and singles, three additional arguments are required:
number of row at which call takes effect (row 0 is the lead end, row
-1 the penultimate row etc) and the place notations for the work of
the bob and single which is substituted at this row. For example;</p>
<pre>CRE> method pb6 "Plain Bob" 6 &x16x16x16,12 0 14 1234</pre>

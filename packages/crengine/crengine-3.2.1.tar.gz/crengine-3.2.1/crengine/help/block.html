<h1>Defining blocks (block)</h1>
<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>block <em>id</em> <em>description</em> <em>nbells</em> [<em>leadlen</em>]</p>
<p>clear <em>id</em></p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A block is a list of rows to be rung. It is usually a true
performance, e.g. a plain course in a method, touch, quarter peal or a
full peal, but may be a false composition
</p>

<h2>Declaring a new block</h2>
<p>
The <em>block</em> comand declares a new block containing only the
initial reference row (rounds) and to which additional rows may be
appended. The following arguments are required:
</p>
<p>id: Identifier for block</p>
<p>description: Description of block</p>
<p>nbells: Number of bells (3-16)</p>
<p>leadlen: Length of a plain lead (optional)</p>
<p>
Specifying the length of the plain lead (leadlen) ensures that the
method is printed correctly with no leads broken across columns. By
default it is twice the number of bells, which is suitable for
treble-hunting methods; e.g. Plain Bob. For treble-dodging methods it
should be changed to 4 x nbells (e.g. 24 for surprise minor). Stedman
and Erin use a fixed lead length of 6 rows.
</p>
<p>
The following example declares a block, suitable for touches of Plain Bob Minor:
</p>
<pre>
CRE> block fred "Fred's Touch of Plain Bob" 6 12
</pre>

<h2>Clearing a block</h2>
<p>
The <em>clear</em> command removes all rows from the block, except the
initial rounds. Block settings, such as number of bells, lead length
and any block level variables are preserved.

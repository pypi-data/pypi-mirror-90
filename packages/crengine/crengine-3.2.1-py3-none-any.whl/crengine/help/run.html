<h1>Running commands from scripts (input, run)</h1>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>input <em>filename</em></p>
<p>run <em>filename</em></p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Both <em>input</em> and <em>run</em> read and run CRE commands from a file.</p>
<p>
input runs the commands in the current session; therefore any
variable reassigments methods and blocks declared in the file will be
available in the session after the script has completed.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, <em>run</em> executes the script in a subsession. While
the subsession inherits settings from its parent session, any
assignments made in the subsession do not persist when transfer of
control is returned to the original session.

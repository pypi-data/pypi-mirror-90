<h1>Chiming bells (chime, stop)</h1>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>chime <em>tower_id</em> <em>bells</em></p>
<p>stop <em>tower_id</em></p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Chiming provides a quick way to hear what bell samples and particular
rows (changes) sound like, without having to ring methods. Simple
tunes may even be played on them!
</p>

<h2>Chiming bells</h2>
<p>
In its simplest form, the a single bell may be chimed; for example to
hear bell 7 (sample 7.wav) of St Wilfrid's Harrogate (an 8 bell tower)
</p>
<pre>
CRE> tower wilf "Harrogate St Wilfrid"
CRE> chime wilf 7
</pre>
<p>
Whole rows may be played; for example, to ring the Whittingtons change
(531246) on the back 6 of an 8 bell tower
</p>
<pre>
CRE> tower wilf "Harrogate St Wilfrid"
CRE> chime wilf 753468
</pre>

<h2>Playing tunes</h2>
<p>
By default, all notes played are crochets (single beat). To alter the
duration, a duration parameter may follow the group of notes; for
example to play the above as quavers (half beat):
</p>
<pre>
CRE chime wilf 753468,0.5
</pre>
<p>
Timings may be mixed, by separating groups of notes by spaces; for
example to play the first line of <em>Oranges and Lemons</em>
</p>
<pre>
CRE> tower wilf "Harrogate St Wilfrid"
CRE> chime wilf 464 68 76,0.5 574 6 8,2
</pre>
<p>
N.B. The duration of a crochet (1 beat) may be controlled by changing
the value of <em>tempo</em> - a number in beats per minute.
</p>

<h2>Stopping bells sounding (stop)</h2>
<p>
When each bell strikes, it resonates until it strikes again. To stop
all bells resonating, the stop command may be used; for example
</p>
<pre>
stop wilf
</pre>

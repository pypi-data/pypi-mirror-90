<h1>Place Notation</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Place notation is a short-hand convention for specifying the plain
lead of a method.
</p>
<p>
Between each row of a plain lead, each bell either remains in its
place makes the place or swaps place with its neighbour. In place
notation, the places which are made in each row are specified; the
other bells assuming to be part of pairs that swap. For example, the
plain lead of Plain Bob Doubles is
</p>
<pre>
5.1.5.1.5.1.5.1.5.125
</pre>
<p>
This may be shortened by realising that the work, excluding the lead
end (last row) is symmetrical about the half-lead (fifth row). It may
therefore be written as
</p>
<pre>
&5.1.5.1.5,125
</pre>
<p>
The ampersand & means reflect the following rows, upto the comma,
about the last row before the comma. Rows after the comma are then
added after.
</p>
<p>
In even bell methods, there is the possibility that all pairs of bells
swap place in a row. For these rows, X is used to denote this. For
example, St Clementâ€™s College Bob Minor is
</p>
<pre>
&X16X36X36,12
</pre>

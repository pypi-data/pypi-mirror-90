<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>save [<em>filename</em>]</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The <em>save</em> command saves the values of all variables and the
definitions of all objects (except the rows in blocks) to a CRE script
file which may be read in with <em>input</em>.
</p>
<p>
If no filename is given, then the settings will be written
to <em>default.txt</em> in the library folder, so that they are
automatically executed the next time that CRE is run.

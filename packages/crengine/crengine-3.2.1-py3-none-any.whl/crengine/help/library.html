<h1>CRE Method Library (makelibrary, load, unload, list)</h1>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
CRE stores methods in a database. It is maintained in a number of CSV
files, which are also called volumes (which may be edited in Excel).
</p>
<p>CRE comes with the following volumes:</p>
<p><em>plain</em> - Plain methods (treble plain hunts)</p>
<p><em>principle</em> - Principles: all bells do the same work</p>
<p><em>trebledodging</em> - treble-bob, delight and surprise</p>
<p>These volumes exist as CSV files in the <em>methods</em> folder of
the CRE folder structure</p>

<h2>Creating the Database</h2>
<p>
On the first time that CRE run, the library database is automatically
created with the default volumes. The library is retained and
available for subsequent runs. To recreate the library at anytime, use
the command <em>makelibrary</em>.
</p>

<h2>Listing available volumes</h2>
<p>
To list volumes in the library, use the <em>listvolumes</em> command. It only
shows the name of the volume, and not the contents. For example:
</p>
<pre>
CRE> listvolumes
default
plain
principle
trebledodging
</pre>

<p>
N.B. there is a volume called <em>default</em> which consists of plain
hunting on all the available numbers of bells. It cannot be changed or
removed.
</p>

<h2>Making changes to volume and reloading</h2>
<p>
In order to make changes, for example to add a new method, the volume
CSV file must be edited and reloaded into the library. To reload a
particular volume, use the <em>loadvolume</em> command; for example:
</p>
<pre>
CRE> loadvolume trebledodging trebledodging.csv
</pre>

<h2>Removing a volume</h2>
<p>
To remove a volume, use the <em>unloadvolume</em> command; for example
</p>
<pre>
CRE> unloadvolume trebledodging
</pre>

<h2>Structure of a volume</h2>

<p>
The comma separated value (CSV) file for the volume has the following
columns, which are also used by the <em>method</em> command:
</p>

<p><em>Method Name (A)</em> - name of method, without the suffix</p>
<p><em>Number of Bells (B)</em> - number of bells</p>
<p><em>Plain Lead (C)</em> - place notation for a plain lead. Excel
will output the value in quotes if it contains any commas</p>
<p><em>Call Row (D)</em> - row of plain lead where call takes effect
(0 is the leadend, -1 is the penultimate row etc)</p>
<p><em>Bob (E)</em> - place notation of the rows to be substituted for a
bob (blank if bobs not used)</p>
<p><em>Single (F)</em> - place notation of the rows to be substituted for
a single (blank if singles not used)</p>

<p>
Volumes can contain any number of methods, provided the method name
(for a particular number of bells) is unique. Also the method name
must be unique across all volumes; for example it is not possible to
call a 6 bell method "Fred" in both the plain and trebledodging
volumes. In this example, Plain Bob Minimus, Grandsire Doubles and
Plain Bob Doubles are defined.

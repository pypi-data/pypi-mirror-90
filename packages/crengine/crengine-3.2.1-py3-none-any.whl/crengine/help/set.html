<h1>Setting variables (set, unset)</h1>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>set <em>variable</em> <em>value</em></p>
<p>set <em>object.variable</em> <em>value</em></p>
<p>unset <em>object.variable</em></p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
CRE uses variables to control how the program works, including how
method are rung and printed. These variables may be set either
globally or local to a particular method or block.
</p>
<p>
Variables are set globally using the set command; for example to
show bells 1 and 4 with trace lines on all methods:
</p>
<pre>CRE> set tracebells 14</pre>
<p>
To set a variable only for a particular method or block, then its id
must be prefixed to the name; for example to show bells 1 and 4 with
tracelines for just block <em>pb5</em>:
</p>
<pre>CRE> set pb5.tracebells 14</pre>
<p>
Settings for method or block level variables may be cancelled by
using <em>unset</em>; for example to revert the trace lines of
block <em>pb5</em> back to the global setting
</p>
<pre>CRE> unset pb5.tracebells</pre>
<p>
Unsetting a variable globally is not permitted; to do so would have
an adverse effect on the functioning of CRE.

<h1>Tower Mapping File (tower.csv)</h1>

<p>
The tower map file of a tower determines which bells are used to ring
methods for each possible number of bells (stages). It is a CSV file
called <em>tower.csv</em> in a tower folder and may be edited with a
spreadsheet application e.g. Excel.
</p>

<p>
For an 8 bell tower an sample bell map is:
</p>
<pre>
key,value
nbells,8
bellset,12345678
3,345
4,1234
5,34567
6,345678
7,2345678
8,12345678
</pre>

<p>The following settings are used:</p>

<p><em>nbells</em> - This is the maximum number of bells that may be
rung on this tower. This setting must always be present.</p>

<p><em>bellset</em> - These are the bell sample files which are
available in this folder; for example 12345678 means there are files
called 1.wav, 2.wav, all the way through to 8.wav.</p>

<p><em>(number)</em> - These settings specify which bells are rung for
methods of that number of bells. By default, a continuous sequence of
bells ending at the tenor is rung. For example for 5 bells, 4,5,6,7,8
would be rung, but here it is overriden by <em>5,34567</em> so that
the minor five (3,4,5,6,7) would be rung.</p>

<p><em>samples</em> - This optional setting may be used to specify
that the sample files from another tower folder be used instead on the
ones in this folder. This enables the same set of bell sample files to
be used with a different configuration; for example, on a 12 bell
tower, an option to ring a light eight using a semitone bell rather
than the back eight.</p>

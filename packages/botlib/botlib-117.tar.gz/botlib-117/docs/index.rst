Welcome to BOTLIB,

BOTLIB is a pure python3 bot library you can use to program bots.
BOTLIB uses a JSON in file database with a versioned readonly storage. It 
reconstructs objects based on type information in the path and is a "dump 
OOP and use OP" programming library where the methods are factored out into
functions that use the object as the first argument. This to obtain a clean
namespace object, which has no methods to clutter the namespace. A "clean",
still has hidden methods, loadable from JSON object, that provides load/save
methods to other classes derived from Object.

BOTLIB is placed in the Public Domain and has no COPYRIGHT and no LICENSE.

OBJECT PROGRAMMING
==================

BOTLIB provides a "move all methods to functions" like this:

::

 obj.method(*args) -> method(obj, *args) 

 e.g.

 not:

 >>> from bot.obj import Object
 >>> o = Object()
 >>> o.set("key", "value")
 >>> o.key
 'value'

 but:

 >>> from bot.obj import Object, set
 >>> o = Object()
 >>> set(o, "key", "value")
 >>> o.key
 'value'

it's a way of programming with objects, replacing OOP. Not object-oriented 
programming, but object programming. If you are used to functional programming
you'll like it (or not) ;]

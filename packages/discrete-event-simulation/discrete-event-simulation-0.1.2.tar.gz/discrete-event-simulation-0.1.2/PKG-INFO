        # Discrete event simulation
        
        This package can be used to create a discrete event simulation based on your parameters. Just install the library (pypi library is WIP) and use
        the `DiscreteSimulation` class to run with your environment.
        
        ## How to apply it to your scenario
        
        Check out the [examples](https://github.com/AlexanderGrooff/discrete-event-simulation/tree/master/examples) where scenarios are sketched out using this framework.
        The idea is that you state one or more available actions that the simulation can pick from which have a starting condition and events to trigger.
        
        The events that are triggered by actions will modify the state, which is tracked in the simulation's `Timeline`.
        
        ## Development
        
        Make a virtualenv, install requirements and run `tox` to ensure everything works. It works from Python 3.8+.
        
        ```
        mkvirtualenv -a . -p python3 $(basename $(pwd))
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        tox
        ```

Description: KOA Table Access Protocol (TAP) Client
        ======================================
        
        Version 1 of PyKOA offers access to public raw science and calibration files 
        acquired with the HIRES echelle-spectrograph, and for Keck Observatory PIs, 
        secure access to their protected data with the KOA credentials already assigned
        to them. The remaining Keck instruments are expected to be available before the
        end of 2020. Queries made through PyKOA are underpinned by nexsciTAP, a NExScI 
        Python-based server that implements the IVOA Table Access Protocol (TAP). 
        This design enables a rich variety of searches, including cone, box, polygon, 
        or all-sky spatial searches; temporal searches; searches on program 
        infortmation; and complex searches on multiple attributes.
        
        The Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) is a collaboration between the NASA 
        Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI) and the W. M. Keck Observatory (WMKO). 
        NExScI is sponsored by NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program, and operated by 
        the California Institute of Technology in coordination with the Jet Propulsion 
        Laboratory (JPL).
        
        If you used PyKOA in your resesearch, please acknowledge KOA as follows: 
        
            "This research has made use of the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA), which 
            is operated by the W. M. Keck Observatory and the NASA Exoplanet Science 
            Institute (NExScI), under contract with the National Aeronautics and 
            Space Administration." 
        
        Please also acknowledge the PI(s) of datasets that have been accesses 
        through PyKOA.

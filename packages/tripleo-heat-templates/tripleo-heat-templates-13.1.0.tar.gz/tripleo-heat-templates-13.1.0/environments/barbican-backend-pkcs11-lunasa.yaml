# A Heat environment file to enable the barbican PKCS11 crypto backend with
# a Lunasa HSM.
# Note that barbican needs to be enabled in order to use this.
parameter_defaults:
  # In order to use this backend, you need to uncomment these values and
  # provide the appropriate values.
  #
  # BarbicanPkcs11CryptoLogin: Password (PIN) to login to PKCS11 session
  # BarbicanPkcs11CryptoSlotId: Slot Id for the HSM.  Note that this parameter is only
  #   strictly required when setting up the Lunasa client in non-HA mode.  In HA
  #   mode, whatever value is placed here will be overridden by the dynamically generated
  #   slot for the HA group created on the client.
  # BarbicanPkcs11CryptoGlobalDefault: Whether this plugin is the global default plugin
  #
  # LunasaClientIPNetwork: (Optional) Network to be used by the controllers
  #   to connect to the HSM.  By default this option is empty ('') and the
  #   controllers are registered on the HSM using the controller's FQDN.
  #   When this option is set, the controllers will be registered using the
  #   controller's IP on this network instead.

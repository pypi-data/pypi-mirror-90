pyfastx.Fasta
-------------

.. py:class:: pyfastx.Fasta(file_name, uppercase=True, build_index=True, full_index=False, full_name=False, memory_index=False, key_func=None)

	Read and parse fasta files. Fasta can be used as dict or list, you can use index or sequence name to get a sequence object, e.g. ``fasta[0]``, ``fasta['seq1']``

	:param str file_name: the file path of input FASTA file

	:param bool uppercase: always output uppercase sequence, default: ``True``

	:param bool build_index: build index for random access to FASTA sequence, default: ``True``. If build_index is False, iteration will return a tuple (name, seq); If build_index is True, iteration will return a sequence object.

	:param bool full_index: calculate character (e.g. A, T, G, C) composition when building index, this will improve the speed of GC content extracting. However, it will take more time to build index, default: ``False``

	:param bool full_name: use the full header line instead of the part before first whitespace as the identifier of sequence, even in mode without building index. New in 0.6.14, default: ``False``

	:param bool memory_index: if memory_index is True, the fasta index will be kept in memory and do not generate a index file, default: ``False``

	:param function key_func: new in 0.5.1, key function is generally a lambda expression to split header and obtain a shortened identifer, default: ``None``

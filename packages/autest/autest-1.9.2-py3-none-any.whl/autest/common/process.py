        Kills a process with all its children

        Current issue... Windows is a message based system. Classic CLI programing generally does not use message pumps.
        By design windows does not use interupts, but instead an event based system. This mean the way 
        CTRL-C is handled is different from that of POSIX like OS systems. In this case Windows dispatched a CTRL-C to 
        all processes in a given console windows. It does not give it to given process. To work around this we can make
        a stub program that can assign itself to a new console windows, dispatch the ctrl-c simutlated event to allow for 
        the POSIX like sig.int logic. Otherwise, windows really was thinking you would send a quit messages and it 
        would shut down before you did a terminate.

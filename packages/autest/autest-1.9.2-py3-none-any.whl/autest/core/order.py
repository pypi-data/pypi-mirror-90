        States that you want to start the provided Process object before the called object.
        The optional ready argument can be a number or function to tell when

        This is useful when certain states or time delays are needed before the next process can start.
        This function has to be added via named arguments.
        Likewise, arguments can be provided to the ready function via named arguments to help control behavior.

                Named argument that can be provided to tell when the next process should start.
                The value can be a number, which will tell in second how long to wait.
                If the value is a function, the function needs to return True when the state is ready,
                and False when it is not.

# at the moment this only works with processes
# everything else at the moment is a straight depends setup
# ie use of ready does not seem to have value for ordering Tests or TestRuns
# as those items are sequential in nature while Processes are asynchronous,
# and need a delay to help allow the sequential execution to work correctly.

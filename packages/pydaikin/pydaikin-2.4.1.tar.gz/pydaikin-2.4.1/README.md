PyDaikin is a standalone program and a library that interface AirConditioners from Daikin.

Currently the following Daikin WiFi modules are supported:

* BRP069Axx/BRP069Bxx/BRP072Axx
* BRP15B61 aka. AirBase (similar protocol as BRP069Axx)
* BRP072B/Cxx (needs https access and a key)
* SKYFi (different protocol, have a password)

The integration was initially built by Yari Adan, but lately have been taken over by Fredrik Erlandsson.

Description: # django-easy-drf
        
        A package that makes for you the repetitive work of creating Serializers, ViewSets and urls for django rest framework.
        
        ## Installation
        On a virtualenv run:
        ```
        pip install django-easy-drf
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        On the same virtualenv, you will have *easy-drf* command available, so run:
        ```
        easy-drf
        ```
        This command will create serializers.py, views.py and urls.py files on the same directory, with all the classes created.
        
        Note: requires that a file called models.py exists on the current directory.
        
        ##### Forcing creation
        If you want to avoid command prompt, you can force it:
        ```
        easy-drf --force
        ```
        or less verbose:
        ```
        easy-drf -f
        ```
        ##### Creating only one file
        Sometimes you don't need all files (views, serializers and urls) so you can specify which ones should be created. Options are:
        - 's' for serializers.py
        - 'v' for views.py
        - 'u' for urls.py
        
        For example, this command will create serializers.py and views.py
        ```
        easy-drf --files s v
        ```
        If you don't specify --files argument, all files will be created.
        
        ##### Getting help
        For help, type:
        ```
        easy-drf --help
        ```
        or less verbose:
        ```
        easy-drf -h
        ```
        This command will list the available cli options.
        
        #### Future developments

        - [x] Allow users to force script without prompt.
        - [x] Allow users to create just one specific file.

Description: Sale Opportunity Module
        #######################
        
        The sale_opportunity module defines the lead/opportunity model.
        
        Lead/Opportunity
        ****************
        
        The lead and opportunity are defined by the same record but with different state.
        Depending on the state, fields of the record become mandatory. Here is the
        extensive list of the fields, most of them are optional:
        
        - Party: The customer.
        - Contact: The contact who placed the order.
        - Address: The main address of the customer.
        - Description: The description of the lead/opportunity.
        - Number: The internal reference of the lead/opportunity (will be generated
          automatically at creation).
        - Reference: The optional external reference of the order.
        - Amount: The estimated revenue amount.
        - Currency: Define the currency of the amount.
        - Probability: The probability of conversion.
        - Company: The company which issue the lead/opportunity.
        - Employee: The employee responsible of the lead/opportunity.
        - Start Date: When the lead started.
        - End Date: When the lead ends (automatically set on win, cancel or lost).
        - Payment Term: Define which payment term will be used for the future invoice.
        - Comment: A text field to add custom comments.
        - State: The state of the lead/opportunity. May take one of the following
          values:
        
            - Lead
            - Opportunity
            - Converted
            - Won
            - Cancelled
            - Lost
        
        - Lines: A list of *Lead/Opportunity* line
        - Sales: The list of sales converted from this opportunity.
        - History: The list of changes made over time to the lead/opportunity.
        
        The first time an opportunity is converted, a sale is created base on the
        information of the opportunity and the lines.
        The amount of the opportunity is later updated with the sales amount.
        Once all the sales of an opportunity are confirmed (or cancelled with at least
        one confirmed), the opportunity is won.
        If all the sales of an opportunity are cancelled than the opportunity is lost.
